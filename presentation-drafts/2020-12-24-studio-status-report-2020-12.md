# studio status report: 2020-12

## month 12 of 2020 was about _the data_ behind the Index layout

I have always been fractal with the rabbit holes 🐇🕳 I may break things but I do not move “fast.” I got “lost” this month in formally thinking about the data I would be using to drive the display of [the index layout work](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/nodejs/tree/master/responsive-layouts) from last month.

## sketching out a development schedule (revision 11)

The schedule of the month:

- add Stills API to `Songhay.Player` (b-roll player) 🕸🌩
- consider upgrading to .NET Core 3.0
- use `@songhay/index` as a side-car app for “Day Path” and “the rasx() context” 🚛📦
- add proposed [content Web component](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-web-components/issues/10)
- use the learnings from existing npm packages to build `@songhay/player-audio-???` 📦✨
- modernize the kinté hits page into a progressive web app 💄✨
- convert Day Path Blog and SonghaySystem.com to HTTPs by default 🔐
- use the learnings of previous work to upgrade and re-release the kinté space 🚀
