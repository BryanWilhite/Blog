# studio status report: 2020-12

## month 12 of 2020 was about _the data_ behind the Index layout

I have always been fractal with the rabbit holes üêáüï≥ I may break things but I do not move ‚Äúfast.‚Äù I got ‚Äúlost‚Äù this month in formally thinking about the data I would be using to drive the display of [the index layout work](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/nodejs/tree/master/responsive-layouts) from last month.

I have written ‚Äú[Songhay Publications and the Concept of the Index](http://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/entry/2020-12-24-songhay-publications-and-the-concept-of-the-index/)‚Äù to really think about Index data. This discussion with myself produced these Studio novelties:

```typescript
interface IndexEntry extends Partial<Segment> {
  segments?: IndexEntry[];
  documents?: Partial<Document>[];
}

interface SearchIndexEntry extends Partial<Document> {
  string extract;
}
```

## the first dedicated Linux workstations in the Studio

For most of 2018 and almost all of 2019, I suffered with Hyper-V-related and VirtualBox-related crashes in Windows 10. I assume these crashes were largely related to my use of AMD-based hardware. Nevertheless, I took these rude interruptions as a prompt for me to move my Ubuntu-desktop-based workflows (featuring Visual Studio Code) to real hardware. I have been experimenting with Linux on Windows-hosted VMs since the early 2000s. The time to move on was long gone: I went with the ASUS PB50 Barebone MiniPC with AMD Ryzen 7 3750H [[NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/asus-pb50-bbr009md/p/N82E16856110195?Description=ryzen%20mini%20pc&cm_re=ryzen_mini%20pc-_-9SIAB94BEN4139-_-Product), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Integrated-Radeon-DisplayPort-Bluetooth-PB50-BBR009MD/dp/B081B5QTCY/ref=pd_di_sccai_1/144-7585039-8084019?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B081B5QTCY&pd_rd_r=2afe08bc-a6cd-401f-945c-18ad7d585ff8&pd_rd_w=HdGbL&pd_rd_wg=DT0zi&pf_rd_p=c9443270-b914-4430-a90b-72e3e7e784e0&pf_rd_r=43VPS6PTTGJ1KMY54JQV&psc=1&refRID=43VPS6PTTGJ1KMY54JQV)].

## the ‚Äòpressure‚Äô is on to upgrade to .NET 5

This is a common occurrence in this Studio: Project _A_ takes so long that Project _B_ (which is queued behind _A_) _must_ be done. For the ‚Äú10x developer‚Äù that does almost nothing in their life but work on .NET, it should have been super-duper obvious to me that when .NET Core 2.2 went to end-of-life ([announced this month last year](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-2-will-reach-end-of-life-on-december-23-2019/)) I should have upgraded everything to .NET 3.0.

In [.NET Rocks! #1719](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1719), Scott Hunter is basically saying (towards the end of the episode) that, going forward from .NET 5.0, upgrades should be easy and _expected_. When a development team uses a LTS version of any software, updates are part of the deal. The practice of writing software and stuffing it away and never looking at it again is only something the people that sign the checks of developers can do and still regard themselves as _professional_. So I need to be more professional here.

The end-of-life announcement did not make me upgrade. What is pressuring me is the embarrassingly recent discovery (in 2020) that Visual Studio 2019 with .NET 5 _should_ no longer need the `x86` version of the .NET Core SDK to run tests in the IDE correctly. Finding documentation on this issue is challenging because ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù (myself included) is using Visual Studio Code _more_ than Visual Studio. The one low-hanging hint out there is the fact that a version of the .NET 5 SDK ships with Visual Studio 2019.

## day-job drama: needing to know what happened between .NET 4.5.x and 4.6.x

Unless I am deeply mistaken‚Äîand I _can_ be deeply mistaken, having the latest version of Visual Studio (or the equivalent SDK) allows us to compile ‚Äúdown‚Äù any advanced syntax to earlier versions of .NET. The problem with day-job drama is not knowing whether everyone on the ‚Äúteam‚Äù is using the ‚Äòright‚Äô version of Visual Studio. This annoying concern has led me to carefully study ‚Äú[What‚Äôs new in .NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/whats-new/)‚Äù and ‚Äú[The history of C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history#c-version-50)‚Äù (with a little [help from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))) to arrange an eye-opening table:

üò≤üí° It is clear to me now that .NET Framework 4.7.1 (and everyone on _at least_ Visual Studio 2017) is the sweet spot for teams with heavy legacy load as they can iteratively move most library projects to .NET Core, targeting .NET Standard while still staying with the ‚Äúold‚Äù .NET Framework.

BTW: since recruiters ask me this question too often, I need to recall that I probably started using the .NET Framework in 2003 when version 1.1 was released [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history)].

## sketching out a development schedule (revision 11)

- add proposed [content Web component](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-web-components/issues/10)
- use the learnings from existing npm packages to build `@songhay/player-audio-???` üì¶‚ú®
- modernize the kint√© hits page into a progressive web app üíÑ‚ú®
- convert Day Path Blog and SonghaySystem.com to HTTPs by default üîê
