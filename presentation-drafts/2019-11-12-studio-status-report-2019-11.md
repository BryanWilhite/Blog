## studio status report: 2019-11

## month 11 is about day job 🐰🕳 the Tweeted Links Builder

The day job leads me lodge some issues, reminding me to revive and research a few things:

* <https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Blog/issues/15>
* <https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Blog/issues/20>

The switch to an 11ty-based, markdown-based world means the Tweeted Links system has to get in line. The next release of `Songhay.Dashboard` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard)] will show this move, covered in [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/issues/60).

## sketching out a development schedule (revision 5)

Today the studio development schedule looks like this:

* ~~get 11ty pipelines running with the FunkyKB~~ ✔
* ~~migrate Thunderbird email to new Hyper-V Ubuntu VM~~ ✔
* ~~move the kinté space blog to an 11ty pipeline (this has been another emergency *for years*)~~ ✔
* ~~update SonghaySystem.com with my new `@songhay/player-video-you-tube`~~ ✔
* ~~convert the Day Path blog to 11ty~~ ✔
* ~~add markdown support to SonghaySystem.com Tweeted Links Builder~~ ✔
* use `@songhay/index` as a side-car app for “Day Path” and “the rasx() context” 🚛📦
* convert Day Path Blog and SonghaySystem.com to HTTPs by default 🔐
* use the learnings from existing npm packages to build `@songhay/player-audio-???` 📦✨
* set up automated social-media posting with Azure logic apps (and Azure functions orchestration) ☁🤖
* modernize the kinté hits page into a progressive web app 💄✨
* use the learnings of previous work to upgrade and re-release the kinté space 🚀
