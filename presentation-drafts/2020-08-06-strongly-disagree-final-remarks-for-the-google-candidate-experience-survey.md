# strongly disagree: final remarks for the Google Candidate Experience Survey

Google is a capitalist organization of maximum liberty. It can do whatever it wants until the money runs out—and letting Google-amounts of money run out would be quite insane or an extinction-level event.

Google sent me an email invitation to their Google Candidate Experience Survey for which I answered several times _strongly disagree_. These were my constructive points:

- Google has the resources to stop using standardized tests on candidates.
- Google can use _data_ to customize the hiring process to make automation feel like the personal touch.
- Google can skillfully hide its probing for computer-science competency inside an actual interview instead of an impersonal examination.

Google liberally confuses interview with examination. “Everybody” (almost) in the industry does this. What was appalling to me was when Google began an examination of me _without warning_ on any topic in computer science it liked (and, yes, the list of topics is relatively short, say, less than 30 topics). And an examination is different from a relatively shallow “tech screen” (a.k.a. _phone screen_) which, I think should be on any topic connected to your resume and with little warning. An examination on the other hand is similar to verbally defending your thesis for a masters or doctorate—and this is exactly what I feel Google is looking for: a masters- or doctorate-level computer science candidate with excellent verbal skills. And that is fine. They can do what they want. Just don’t toot the “diversity” horn: Google is looking for any person of any skin color with a Star-Trek-uniform computer science education.

Google makes me angry however when they claim that their interview process is just about getting to know how you think. They just want to know how you think, eh? This is not true: in my case, they wanted to know how I think about Stanford computer-science class problems sprung upon me without warning. As [others have noted](https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/), this is really a test how one performs under anxiety (as a student of Stanford). It is a form of “tough-love” macho violence that is quite a barbaric ritual that any Roman centurion or Sengoku-period samurai would be proud of—and this why the cult of [tech billionaires that worship stoicism](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/325577) will never give these rituals up. In fact, the pressure is a way to weed out the liars and charlatans, right?

There are plenty of articles on the Web about how “hiring is broken” and, years ago, when these complaints first went public, I was passionately in support of what I assumed the intent was behind most of these articles. I assumed most these articles were about trying to change Google in particular and “the industry” in general “for the better.” Now that I am a little older and have seen several publicly-traded outcomes, I can see that Google in particular and “the industry” in general should continue doing what they are doing without me being “excited” to work _for_ them. I am not interested in ‘improving’ Google. Google is _by design_: it is an advertising company that happens to use technology. Amazon is, technically, a [monopsony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony). Fascinating. And Microsoft is… the stock is nice these days.

“The industry” in general is about moving from data breach to data breach with, maybe, a negative carbon footprint in the next 20 years. Now, _my_ home-Studio industry had to develop a _personal_ relationship with computer science. I am a physics major who has had a self-sabotaging-but-justifiable disrespect for computer science. My Google, Amazon and Microsoft interviews all represent catalysts to form a _progressive_, personally-useful respect for computer science. But, before I conclude on that positive note, here are some points around why physics majors righteously underestimate computer science:

- Computer science never (or rarely) exceeds the maths education of a first-year physics student.
- Computer science, like law (and chemistry), is about _memorizing_ historical precedents (mostly algorithm and data-structure dramas) while physics is about finding solutions based on a handful of macroscopic principles (laws) with no real regard for history outside of that which is written in the language of maths.
- Computer science has a religious, historical penchant for c-like languages which biases against functional programming (and the higher-maths elegance any physics girl would love).
- Computer science is culturally about imperative perfection, leading to mechanical devotion to dogmas-_du-jour_ while physics can throw out entire systems of thought that took _centuries_ to establish (like classical mechanics) and storm the Bastille, making mistake after mistake quite openly for the sake of something completely different.
- Computer science is too often about finding flying-buttress of beauty in complexity while physics is frequently stagnating around the desire for poetic simplicity.

[Steven Skiena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Skiena) himself will tell you that a computer scientist is a mathematician that solves all problems with the dominoes of [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction).

Back to the positive note: although the [Jacquard machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine), its relationship to the [Hollerith card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card) is quite fascinating, the drama of computer science that I very much respect begins with the need to search for data _quickly_. Two important points emerge from this need:

1) The quickness of searching depends on _sorting_ data first.
2) The c-language ritual of sorting depends (mostly) on the _for_-loop.

In terms of my _personal_ education (which I have always found to be more important than my reputation as an obedient, stoic, samurai employee), these points are two germs that grow my _authentic_ interest in computer science. This fundamental need for sorting suddenly explains to me why sort algorithms (and sorted tree structures) are so important. This _for_-loop deal leads to my first-year calculus study on finite [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)) which swirls around into expressing [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) and [Big _O_ Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation). Just because I have these authentic germs running around in my head (and heart) does not mean I am ready to give you an implementation-detail-filled lecture on these subjects. I am very proud and pleased to know that having these acting skills _is_ impressive but not debilitatingly important to me—and so far, for the last 24 years, not so important to “the industry” such that I cannot find any senior-level-like programming job.
