# Songhay Publications and the Concept of the Index (2021)

The intent here is to build upon [the 2020 version](http://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/entry/2020-12-24-songhay-publications-and-the-concept-of-the-index/) of this subject and move forward toward techniques that will work well in my Studio.
