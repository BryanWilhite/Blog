# the most important thing I have learned as a developer in the last ten years

I will truly be very, very blessed to have 10 more years of life on this Earth as a productive software developer. The most important thing I have learned as a developer _in the last ten years_ is not some engineering technique. It is more of a _communication_ technique. This is what my father taught me about public speaking:

>Tell them what you are going to tell them. Tell them. Then tell them what you told them.

I my world of agile-like software development, this translates to:

1. tell them what/where you are going to code.
2. code.
3. refer to the artifact produced by step 1.

That step _1_ up there is the most important thing I have learned as a developer in the last ten years. In my agile-like situations, during a sprint we get _cards_. A card (or a ticket) will have a description and [acceptance criteria](https://jelvix.com/blog/user-stories-acceptance-criteria) (when I am lucky). I now see that it is my responsibility to turn that acceptance criteria into a _card plan_.

My card plan is a declaration to the team (and to the entire company) of what I intend to do. By clearly defining this planning step, I am defining a metric that answers the question, How long does it take to develop a plan for a card? Based on my decades of experience it should take me less than six hours to write a plan _when I am working with professionals_. When I am working with rock stars, the plan should already be written (or the plan writes itself).

But let’s get back to my real world: when the card plan takes over 24 hours and “thought leaders” signal that _I_ am the problem, then I know I am surrounded by well-compensated enemies/fools and I should leave the company as soon as possible. In speculative memoriam, I can imagine “thought leaders” (and some managers) from my sordid past pulling moves like:

- suggesting that we are in a state of emergency and we should be _doing_ instead of _writing_ which a luxury for those not about to go out of business (apparently, for the last 10 years)
- suggesting that, because I am a _senior_ developer, the need to write out this plan is a sign of weakness and reeks of an impostor
- feeling like it is a waste of time to write out these plans (for a narcissist who designed a _very proprietary_, monolithic system over _a period of years_) and within 90 days a _senior_ developer should “get up to speed” without any help (no face-to-face questions really answered, no documentation, no unit tests, no product training materials)
- when a bug breaks out related my work, _not_ going back to read my card plan to see that my plan steps were _not_ related to the bug which implies the story needed to be rewritten and the Product Owner(s) are in error
- immediately assuming that these plans would be too detailed and lengthy instead of curt, precise summaries, literally documenting how a developer’s knowledge of the system is increasing because _it is harder to write something short_ rather than rambling on
- insisting that we “talked” about what needed to be done and taking the time write down what was talked about is just a waste of time (because “everyone” has an on-command, intimate memory of what was said when “we live and breathe” this everyday as there is no other “life” but our time in this office building)

So the point I am trying to make is that I have spent most of my adult, work-for-hire “life” _non_-working with people who were eager to blame me (as I am usually the outsider in so many ways) when shit went wrong instead of taking a humble look at themselves and their long-time colleagues _first_. Usually, I am hired help the team do something they have never done before (largely because a previous employee with my skills and more left the company—which should be a red flag to me); _rarely_ am I hired to do something that someone else already present can do (or wants to do).

[According to people who are not me](https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/),

> Developers spend most of their time figuring the system out.

My card planning step is a simple, measurable recognition of this unromantic reality. And it is too tempting for incumbent management (and their seconds in command) to accuse a new developer of being stupid rather than admit that their system is too fucked up (and too neglected) to figure out _easily_. When you or someone under your watch designed a system that your tool vendor would consider “experimental” at best or hostile to the vendor road-map at worst, then your shit is _probably_ fucked up. When you release pre-alpha-ish code to me expecting me to write unit tests for it, then your shit is _probably_ fucked up. When your service-oriented architecture is not taking advantage of [the true intent behind microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzMLg3Ys5vI), then your shit is _probably_ fucked up. This is what one manager (who is actually quite a brilliant chap) described as my [probalistic thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_logic).

I have worked with assholes who would have prevented me from publishing my card plan in an inter-departmental forum (like [JIRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jira_(software))) because it would reveal to non-technical people what is actually going on. In my new-guy ignorance, I would be unaware that some “embellishments” were in play and my transparency would be seen as an hostile act of sabotage instead of something inclusive and constructive. Had I known about this technique earlier in my career, it would have been easier to find these assholes faster.

My card plan is also a way to find out whether I am an idiot faster as well (of course!). I would rather be called a stupid planner than a stupid _developer_ because I have _never_ celebrated my planning abilities on my resume. In fact, the very reality around why I am an employee of corporation I do not own betrays my weak planning skills. I wasted much of my “life” confusing _planning_ work with actually working. (Actually, more of my professional life was wasted waiting for the first draft of the [agile manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#The_Agile_Manifesto).) I would have been able to position myself psychologically in the space where I am not _blindly_ angry because an asshole is trying to accuse me of being lazy. When an asshole defines work as _pretending_ to know what I am doing, then yes, bitch, I am lazy.

## um, can a PR _duplicate_ your card plan?

This is a passive-aggressive, science-fiction, time-traveling question asked by an asshole who does not like to write in human readable languages. The answer to this fantastic (as in science-fiction _fantasy_) question is _yes_. In fact, a PR (a [pull request](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_Request)) can be proof that a card plan worked which means it is effectively a _duplicate_ of a card plan. But the card plan is meant for humans to read and is used as a historical journal entry to uncover and measure units of work. It is also a warning in place sent to the stakeholders of what is about to happen while the PR records what actually happened (assuming the [commit comments](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) are excellent). In the world of unit testing, this is _expected_ and _actual_, respectively.

## er, why do you say “agile-ish”

Sadly, kids, most “normal” Americans are in management (or they leave the industry) before the end of their second decade as a software developer. Few would agree, but I argue that this is case because few organizations have agile values at the core. The agile values I have been hinting at in this artifact you are reading here are:

- Transparency
- Artifacts
- Inspection

These are filed under [Empirical Process Control](https://www.scrumstudy.com/whyscrum/scrum-empirical-process-control). In most of the organizations I have experienced, transparency is forced on the organization through some third-party investigation which can escalate to litigation.

Almost every agile-ish organization is ‘forced’ to define units of work to be done in a clearly defined work period (_sprint_). This helps to prevent leadership from changing the work that needs to be done without warning (which happened quite a bit before my pre-agile-ish days).

However, I use the term agile-ish because my post-agile-manifesto work history is littered with companies that routinely violate the clearly defined work period, placing pressure on developers instead of product owners/stakeholders. There is a double meaning to the phrase “push beyond the boundaries” which can romantically suggest a passionate quest for innovation or can be an ask for human beings to destroy their work-life balance without mercy _for years_. Too many organizations are caught up in the romance and eagerly look for a chance to “push beyond the boundaries” which can translate into giving team members _too much_ work to do. Having enough time to actually _plan_ what you are going to do is a red flag for these toxic people that you do not have enough work. These people are garbage, of course.

## how does your card plan write itself?

When the acceptance criteria uses domain names (or business terminology) that maps directly to source-control artifacts, the card plan writes itself. In my ignorance, I assume that [SpecFlow and Gherkin](https://specflow.org/learn/gherkin/) can automate this process. In my current day job, there is the promise (or very strong suggestion) that I will have the opportunity to look into this technology further.
