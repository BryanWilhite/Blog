# Flippant Remarks about Responsive Images

Self-identifying [10x developer](https://twitter.com/ireaderinokun/status/1249752431002619911), Ire Aderinokun (@ireaderinokun) was one of earliest writers on the subject of responsive images that addressed its combinatorial complexities _in an actionable way_. In 2016, with “[Responsive Images—The `srcset` and `sizes` Attributes](https://bitsofco.de/the-srcset-and-sizes-attributes/)”, she adeptly cut through to the technical issue at hand: the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.

In 2017, a [learnedia.com article](https://learnedia.com/responsive-images-srcset-attribute-picture-element/) addresses the other major issue related to implementing responsive images: when to use the `picture` element:

>In case you are using `<picture>` element, you are strictly telling browser which image to use on different viewport widths. …This is different because **now browser won’t make a decision on it’s own** which image to serve. That is useful when you are serving different images on different viewport widths. It could also be variations of the same image cropped differently to look better on some devices.
