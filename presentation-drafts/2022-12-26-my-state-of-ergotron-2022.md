# my state of Ergotron: 2022

Ergotron offers [Mobile Workstations](https://www.ergotron.com/en-us/products/workstations/mobile-workstations) mostly for hospital or medical laboratory applications which means safety is key. The safer the product the more expensive it is. This means that mounting an [Ergotron arm](https://www.ergotron.com/en-us/products/mounts/desk-mounts) on a ‚Äúworksurface‚Äù is considered an unsatisfactory risk. For example mounting an arm on the TeachWell might topple it over:

Moreover, the clamping force of the Ergotron arm might crack the ‚Äúphenolic worksurface‚Äù of the TeachWell¬Æ. Paying $800 for these risks is *not* attractive.

What Ergotron offers instead, is the Neo-Flex¬Æ LCD Cart:

This cart is designed to support a monitor on an arm‚Äî*but* it is limited to 27"‚Äîand the arm itself is rather short (to reduce the risk of toppling):

For a couple-hundred dollars more, we can safely cart around monitors up to 42" with the Neo-Flex¬Æ WideView WorkSpace:

\[üîó [Ergotron](https://www.ergotron.com/en-us/products/product-details/24-189#?color=grey) \]

I assume that all of the carts aforementioned can support [LiFeKinnex Technology](https://www.ergotron.com/en-us/company/patented-technology/lifekinnex-technology), supplying the carts with Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) battery power so they can roll around freely! However, the price for this convenience is rather steep: looks like it‚Äôs about *two grand* to get started.

Finally, the Neo-Flex¬Æ Mobile MediaCenter UHD can hold up to 80-inch monitors:

This model is actually less expensive than the Neo-Flex¬Æ WideView WorkSpace in part because (I assume) it does not support LiFeKinnex Technology and the tray does not have retractable surfaces for a mouse.
