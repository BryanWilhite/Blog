# flippant remarks about F\#

F# is the end. This feels like the kind of programming language for an old Microsoft dog like me, retiring to learn new tricks. Before I go on and probably say something not very smart, let me thank the folks that helped me on my F\# journey (in order of appearance):

[Brian Beckman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianbeckman/) [@lorentzframe](https://twitter.com/lorentzframe): As early as 2007, I was floored by Brian Beckman‚Äôs soundbite, ‚ÄúCompositionality controls complexity.‚Äù The word ‚Äúcompositionality‚Äù is a polite reference to functional programming _style_ in general and F# in Microsoft particular. This revolutionary statement (_revolutionary_ to me) was made in what should be his famous video, ‚ÄúBrian Beckman: Don‚Äôt fear the Monad‚Äù [[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8)] (in case you are Microsoft employee and an archivist, the original link was <http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=358968>).

[Don Syme](https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-syme-558b58/) [@dsyme](https://twitter.com/dsyme): Don Syme [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Syme)] evangelized his work on F# from the very beginning. Before Microsoft officially recognized the existence of YouTube, Don Syme was in several Channel 9 videos such as a 2016, _On .NET_ episode, ‚Äú[Don Syme on F#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/on-net/don-syme-on-f).‚Äù

[Jessica Kerr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicakerr/) [@jessitron](https://twitter.com/jessitron): Jessica Kerr is not an F# evangelist but she is an excellent one for [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/). Her [GOTO 2016 conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgXhMc8M4X4) set the stage for me to meet a flavor of [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/) called [Bolero](https://fsbolero.io/). It took me about five years to figure this out.

[Scott Nimrod](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-nimrod-05995413/) [@bizmonger](https://twitter.com/bizmonger): Scott‚Äôs [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bizmonger) about things-mostly-F# dates back to 2013 and I show up around 2017‚Äîand I am sure that Scott is more than a little disappointed that it has taken me over five years to officially get on the F# train! Nevertheless, Scott has been a key figure of my F# journey, introducing me to such folks as [Ody Mbegbu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ody-mbegbu/) [@odytrice](https://twitter.com/odytrice), [Houston Haynes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/houstonhaynes/) [@h3techdev](https://twitter.com/h3techdev) and Adam Wright [@awright18](https://twitter.com/awright18).

[Isaac Abraham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaacabraham/) [@isaac_abraham](https://twitter.com/isaac_abraham): Isaac Abraham, his book [_Get Programming with F#_](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp), was the final conk on the head that made the scales fall from my eyes. I was made aware of this book from a recommendation by Houston Haynes in a Twitter Space hosted by Scott Nimrod. Save yourself five years and start with this book!

With sincere thanks to the people with the names above, let me now get flippant:

## shut up and start with the `|>` operator

One of the many things Isaac Abraham does well, is let us know that we should not get intimidated by the massive ‚Äú[Symbol and operator reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/symbol-and-operator-reference/).‚Äù We should start with the forward pipeline function, `|>` and see how it functions with the last argument of a [curried function](https://swlaschin.gitbooks.io/fsharpforfunandprofit/content/posts/currying.html).

## you are not writing statements in F\#

In F# you are writing _expressions_. For the veteran C# developer, this might sound like you would be writing everything as [expression lambdas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions), making [expression trees](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/). I recommend asking Don Syme about this but to me this sounds right except there is no clunky `Expression<TDelegate>` syntax.

## you ‚Äúhate‚Äù white space in Python?

Should you ‚Äúhate‚Äù the importance of white space in Python then you will ‚Äúhate‚Äù [its importance in F#](https://swlaschin.gitbooks.io/fsharpforfunandprofit/content/posts/fsharp-syntax.html).

## tuples are first-class citizens in F\#

My Isaac-Abraham-led [study of tuples in F#](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/jupyter-central/blob/master/get-programming-with-f-sharp/09-shaping-data-with-tuples.ipynb) shows me that tuples are _fundamental_ to F#. The use of commas in F# is probably expressing a tuple like in this typical `DateTime.TryParse` expression:

```fsharp
match DateTime.TryParse dateTimeString with
| false, _ -> resultError "dc:date"
| true, dateTime -> Ok dateTime
```

## F\# bends over backwards for .NET APIs

That `DateTime.TryParse` expression above is but one example of how much F# recognizes the existence of .NET. I would be a mistake to assume that F# wants to escape or trivialize the .NET ecosystem. It would be better to assume that F# deviates from .NET when it ‚Äúhas not been invented yet‚Äù for the CLR. Another great example of this dedication is the foundational `Option.ofNullable` function [ üìñ [docs](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs/reference/fsharp-core-optionmodule.html#ofNullable)].

## F\# does _not_ really need LINQ

Because I enjoy using [LINQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query) in C# so much, I made [an extensive study of why F# does not really need LINQ](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/jupyter-central/blob/master/get-programming-with-f-sharp/15-working-with-collections-in-fsharp.ipynb) during my reading of [_Get Programming with F#_](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp).

## when F\# is presented as a DSL tool, I think the HTML mini languages are downplayed

According to the great Scott Wlaschin [@ScottWlaschin](https://twitter.com/ScottWlaschin):

>Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are well recognized as a technique to create more readable and concise code. The functional approach is very well suited for this.
>
>‚Äî‚Äú[F# for Fun and Profit](https://swlaschin.gitbooks.io/fsharpforfunandprofit/content/posts/conciseness-functions-as-building-blocks.html)‚Äù

In my opinion, libraries like `Giraffe.ViewEngine` [[GitHub](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe.ViewEngine#html-elements-and-attributes)] should be in _every_ presentation, showing off the DSL features of F# (Don Syme, by the way, does do this but we need others to do more). When we couple these F# HTML DSLs with Microsoft‚Äôs take on [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) which is [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), one (like me) will immediately want to see how F# is married to Blazor. Accordingly, I am currently experimenting with [Bolero](https://fsbolero.io/), a project led by [Lo√Øc Denuzi√®re](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarmil/) [@_Tarmil](https://twitter.com/Tarmil_).

## many of the recent developments in C# were inspired by F\#

Here is an incomplete list of features in C# that _clearly_ come from F#:

- [Pattern Matching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/pattern-matching) (but I think C# has more features)
- [Discards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/discards)
- [Tuple Deconstruction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/deconstruct)

F# also has its own take on generics (as well as supporting .NET generics) which is a key ingredient in the F# type inference system, the [Hindley-Milner (HM) type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system). I explore this while [reading](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/jupyter-central/blob/master/get-programming-with-f-sharp/05-trusting-the-compiler.ipynb) Isaac Abraham‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrusting the compiler‚Äù section of his book, [_Get Programming with F#_](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp).

## because of over 20 years of object-oriented programming, I incorrectly assumed that polymorphism was confined to OOP

While reading Isaac Abraham‚Äôs book (mentioned previously), [I was led away from the pages](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/jupyter-central/blob/master/get-programming-with-f-sharp/21-modeling-relationships-in-f-sharp.ipynb) and discovered _polytypism_ and the subject of [generic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming#Functional_languages). Wow.

## two words _discriminated unions_

A long-time C# developer would see nothing like _discriminated unions_ (DUs) in F# unless one delves [into Typescript](https://medium.com/@ahsan.ayaz/understanding-discriminated-unions-in-typescript-1ccc0e053cf5). My notes on F# DUs should drag the typical C# developer through the ‚Äúmuck‚Äù or through progressive transformation:

- ‚Äú[Modeling relationships in F#](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/jupyter-central/blob/master/get-programming-with-f-sharp/21-modeling-relationships-in-f-sharp.ipynb)‚Äù
- ‚Äú[Business rules as code](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/jupyter-central/blob/master/get-programming-with-f-sharp/23-business-rules-as-code.ipynb)‚Äù
- [even more notes](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/jupyter-central/tree/master/funkykb/fsharp/discriminated-unions) on DUs

Here is my cryptic-or-stupid sound bite about DUs: _Did you ever want to define class hierarchies with regular expressions?_ We do _not_ use regular expressions with DUs but the syntax might _look_ like it!

## while day-jobbing in C\#, lean toward functional style

I have spent most of the last 20 years writing in C# but I was naturally biased toward functional style. I used to think this was a personal, almost _aesthetic_ preference until Brian Beckman made me realize that this is also a _strategic_ preference for the sake of maintainability and clarity.

In a typical C# code review, I should be looking for these functional-style corrections:

| issue | recommendation |
|- |-
| ‚Äòtall‚Äô methods | decompose C# methods with too many lines into [local functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/local-functions) or [extension methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods); the names of these smaller chunks of code might reduce the need for comments |
| blocks of code with nested and/or a succession of `for` loops is hard to read | consider replacing the `for` loops with LINQ `.Select()` methods to ‚Äòpipe‚Äô from one set of data to another |
| disruptive or hard-to-read `if` blocks | use [C# pattern-matching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/pattern-matching) which is heavily influenced by F# |
| wide `if` conditions | decompose into [local functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/local-functions) or [extension methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods) |
| a class has ‚Äòtoo many‚Äô static methods that get in the way of the instance members in terms of readability | consider separating these static methods into [extension methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods) instead of partial classes |
| it is clear that we should return more than one type from a method but defining a class or interface for these types is overkill | return a [tuple with named fields](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples#tuple-field-names) from this C# method |
| the team agrees that we should ‚Äòinject an interface into a method‚Äô but defining a formal interface is overkill | use `Func<>` or `Action<>` in the method signature, effectively touching upon the [Strategy Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) and recognizing the concept of [higher order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) |
| the team is actually sick of `null` | consider using a C# `Option` library, like [Optional](https://github.com/nlkl/Optional) |
| the team is uncomfortable with throwing exceptions deep in the stack and would rather use ‚Äòrailways‚Äô to bubble them up with fine/granular control | consider using a C# implementation of `Result<>` like what is available in [Functional Extensions for C#](https://github.com/vkhorikov/CSharpFunctionalExtensions) which introduces the concept of [Railway Oriented Programming](https://swlaschin.gitbooks.io/fsharpforfunandprofit/content/posts/recipe-part2.html) which is a step above the famous [‚Äúfluent‚Äù C# style](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/development/dotnet-development/fluent-code-in-c/) |
| a team member is called out for [primitive obsession](https://www.arhohuttunen.com/primitive-obsession/) | F# is actually [designed for primitive obsession](https://swlaschin.gitbooks.io/fsharpforfunandprofit/content/posts/designing-with-types-single-case-dus.html) but [there are ways to approach it constructively in C#](https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/functional-c-primitive-obsession/)
