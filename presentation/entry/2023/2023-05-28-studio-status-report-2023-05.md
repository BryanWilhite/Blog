# studio status report: 2023-05

## month 05 of 2023 was about almost finishing the `Songhay.Player.ProgressiveAudio` project and some distracting but necessary Studio research

The ‚Äú`Songhay.Player.ProgressiveAudio` release 6.0.0‚Äù [project](https://github.com/users/BryanWilhite/projects/9) is down to adding the last two components. The [play/pause control](https://rasx-node-js.netlify.app/html5/input-range-play-control/index.html) and the [playlist](https://rasx-node-js.netlify.app/html5/audio-playlist/index.html) which already exist in the form of HTML and JavaScript. These two need ‚Äòtranslation‚Äô into the world of Blazor/Bolero/F‚ôØ. The existence of these samples have not been mentioned in this report since [month 02 of 2023](http://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/entry/2023-02-25-studio-status-report-2023-02/). As usual, I, of course, blame the French for my delay üçüüè¥

The ‚Äúdistractions‚Äù away from finishing the `Songhay.Player.ProgressiveAudio` project are reflected in the density of the Obsidian graph for this month:

![the Obsidian graph for this month](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-19-12-15.png)

Ideally, my selection of Obsidian journal notes for this month will reveal what was so ‚Äúdistracting‚Äù:

## the [[Bulma]] modal does not work with a fixed `navbar`

The [[Bulma]] fixed `navbar` \[üìñ [docs](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/#fixed-navbar) \] hides the `modal-close` visual which is ‚Äúa simple cross located in the top right corner‚Äù \[üìñ [docs](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/modal/) \]. This a classic problem. Moreover, the default [[Bulma]] `navbar` experience is optimized for mobile (small screens) where the ‚Äúsimple cross‚Äù should be easy to find‚Äîand perhaps `navbar` is collapsed or absent.

On the desktop, the current recommendation is to use the [[Bulma]] `message` experience as `modal-content`:

![Progressive Audio app on Studio Floor](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-19-19-20.png)

The `message` close button (strangely called `delete`) invites the user to click closer to the actual message displayed instead of hunting for ‚Äúa simple cross located in the top right corner.‚Äù

## [[Twitter]]: um, yeah‚Ä¶ `CoreTweet` works üéä

<https://github.com/CoreTweet/CoreTweet>

This screenshot is from my first [notebook](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/jupyter-central/blob/master/funkykb/csharp/twitter/core-tweet.ipynb) that loads Studio secrets from an environment variable:

![`CoreTweet` in Jupyter notebook](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-19-24-48.png)
\[üîó [GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/jupyter-central/blob/master/funkykb/csharp/twitter/core-tweet.ipynb) \]

`CoreTweet` is recommended by what‚Äôs left of Twitter:

## [[Bolero]]: lessons learned from building `YouTubeFigureElmishComponent`

This is either a last gasp or the beginning of an actual lifestyle:

![YouTube Figure component](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-19-28-25.png)

This is the `YouTubeFigureElmishComponent` \[üîó [GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/blob/main/Songhay.Dashboard.Client/Components/YouTubeFigureElmishComponent.fs) \]‚Äînow live at [SonghaySystem.com](https://songhaysystem.com/yt/figure)‚Äîwhich is based on [a CodePen](https://codepen.io/rasx/pen/gOjGQOv) of mine.

The greatest lesson learned with this accomplishment is how to implement [binding](https://fsbolero.io/docs/HTML#data-bindings). I see now that:

>[!important]
>[[Bolero]] (two-way?) binding is only available for the `input` element.

Because of this, the `select` element needs the `on.change` event handler:

![Bolero `on.change` event handler](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-19-30-35.png)
\[üîó [GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/blob/810935a7041e5fc74b393e1b1b2acaef1453a6db/Songhay.Dashboard.Client/Components/YouTubeFigureElmishComponent.fs#L49) \]

The JavaScript work done for [the CodePen](https://codepen.io/rasx/pen/gOjGQOv) informs how [[Bolero]] calls out to the [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API):

![Bolero calling the Clipboard API](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-19-31-45.png)
\[üîó [GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/blob/810935a7041e5fc74b393e1b1b2acaef1453a6db/Songhay.Dashboard.Client/Components/ContentBlockProgramComponent.fs#L37) \]

The [[Elmish]] message call is needed to copy the title and link of the YouTube video to the clipboard for pasting into social media. The `jsRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync` invocation needs to be wrapped up in a function and sent to [[Songhay Modules Bolero (F‚ôØ)]] \[üîó [GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Modules.Bolero) \] #to-do

## [[Bolero]]: i propose changing the `ClientUtility` into the `ProgramComponentUtility` #to-do 

The `ProgramComponentUtility` should centralize the `Remote` module that is already there but the new bit is centralizing the expressions that respond to all [[Elmish]] `update` cases. So we would see something like this:

```fsharp
module pcu = ProgramComponentUtility

type MyProgramComponent() =  
    inherit ProgramComponent<MyModel, MyMessage>()

    let update message model =
        match message with
        | Error ex ->
            let cmd = pcu.getCommandForError ‚Ä¶
            model, cmd
        | GetReadMe ->
            let cmd = pcu.getCommandForGetReadMe ‚Ä¶
            model, cmd
        | GotReadMe data ->
            let cmd = pcu.getCommandForGotReadMe ‚Ä¶
            let m = pcu.getStateForGotReadMe ‚Ä¶
            m, cmd
        | MyCompMsg msg ->
            let cmd = pcu.getCommandForMyCompMsg ‚Ä¶
            let m = pcu.getStateForMyCompMsg ‚Ä¶
            m, cmd
        | MyComp2Msg msg2 ->
            let cmd = pcu.getCommandForMyComp2Msg ‚Ä¶
            let m = pcu.getStateForMyComp2Msg ‚Ä¶
            m, cmd

    override this.Program = ‚Ä¶ // calls Program.mkProgram init update view
```

The `update` function shown above is suggesting that for every [[Elmish]] component the top-level message model has to have a member for it. The `update` function is also showing how messages are passed into child [[Elmish]] components which leads to the question, How are messages passed _out_ of these children? #to-do 

## [[Bolero]]: adding a conventional `blazorServices` property to the [[Elmish]] model

Adding a conventional `blazorServices` property:

![`StudioFloor` model](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-19-40-16.png)

The advantages of this move include:

- the need to pass these services via function arguments is eliminated
- the `blazorServices` property declares in one place what services are required for all components in the project
- it further underscores the importance of the `initialize` member

We can also see how this move simplifies the [[Elmish]] `Program` member:

![`Program` member](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-19-41-24.png)

Without this move the `update` function undergoes partial application to ‚Äòhide‚Äô the passing of services from the `Program.mkProgram` function.

## [[Bolero]]: the `pcu` is mostly about getting [[Elmish]] commands

![the `pcu` in the Elmish `update` function](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-19-45-41.png)

![tweet from Bryan Wilhite](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-19-47-37.png)

### the significance of `pcu.getCommandForYt`

The `pcu.getCommandForYt` function shown above is implying that:

1. child [[Elmish]] components should _never_ be responsible for _loading_ the data it depends on
2. _all_ [[Elmish]] commands of the child component(s) can be handled by one function
3. getting an [[Elmish]] command is almost always completely independent from updating the [[Elmish]] model

_1_ is the requirement that makes ‚Äòinstalling‚Äô child [[Elmish]] both flexible (in the face of running over a server with remoting or on the client with `HttpClient`) and awkward.

_2_ is based on the my understanding of [[Elmish]] design: that all [[Elmish]] commands must be recognized by the parent Program. My work so far  has built [[Elmish]] commands that load external data for or send messages to child components.

_2_ also implies how the nesting of [[Elmish]] updates is used as suggested [[2023-05-08#Bolero : Elmish rock star Zaid Ajaj shows me how to scale Elmish apps|by rock star Zaid Ajaj]]. (See `Counter.update` and `Loader.update` in his sample `update` function \[üîó [GitHub](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/scaling-elmish-programs/blob/master/apps/refactored-spaghetti-2/src/App.fs#L27) \].)

_3_ is the justification for preferring the nesting of [[Elmish]] updates; this justification may quickly fall apart with more experience‚Äîor be further justified.

## ok, i get it: the [[Photino]] browser does not support [[WebAssembly]]

This error message is a clue:

![Photino error](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-19-54-11.png)

```console
[Error] Error: Failed to start platform. Reason: RuntimeError: Out of bounds memory access (evaluating 'func.apply(null,cArgs)')
	u (blazor.webassembly.js:1:38561)
	(anonymous function) (blazor.webassembly.js:1:63630)
```

[The docs](https://docs.tryphotino.io/Photino-Blazor) provide a meager hint:

>Photino.Blazor is not Server-Side Blazor, nor is it WASM Client-Side Blazor. When the .NET (console) application starts, it uses the full .NET 6 framework. The framework can be pre-installed on the machine or it can come packaged with the application in the case of a ‚Äúsingle file application.‚Äù Execution of all .NET code in Blazor is redirected to the same framework as the console app.

## [[dotnet|.NET]]: i give up‚Ä¶

I refuse to use server-side Blazor just to get it to run on the Linux Desktop.

>[!info]
>Today, I do not recommend using [[Photino]] in this Studio.

Outside of packaging and deployment for a lay public, I have failed to see how [[Photino]] is superior to a command like this:

```bash
microsoft-edge --new-window --window-size="800,600" --app=https://www.youtube.com
```

I did not find the awesome `--window-size` command line option among the output of `microsoft-edge --help`. The help output sent me to two dead <acronym title="Universal Resource Identifier">URI</acronym>s:

>As a GTK+ app, Microsoft Edge also obeys GTK+ command-line flags, such as `--display`.  See the GTK documentation for more:

The closest resource to the intentions above is: <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man7/gtk-options.7.html>

A search that led to ‚Äú[Edge Command Line Arguments](https://textslashplain.com/2022/01/05/edge-command-line-arguments/)‚Äù led me to the gigantic ‚Äú[List of Chromium Command Line Switches](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/).‚Äù

## [[Azure]]: standardizing Studio cloud üå© security on <acronym title="Role-Based Access Control">RBAC</acronym>

Many days ago in this month‚Äîmiserably late in the night‚ÄîI successfully authenticated against the [[Microsoft Graph]] using `DeviceCodeCredentialOptions` \[üîó [GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/jupyter-central/blob/master/funkykb/csharp/microsoft-graph-to-azure.ipynb) \] and `ClientSecretCredential` \[üîó [GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/jupyter-central/blob/master/funkykb/csharp/microsoft-graph-app-only.ipynb) \]. What remained a challenge until today was _authorization_. This failure is characterized by `AuthorizationPermissionMismatch` error codes and ‚ÄúCaller is not authorized to perform action on resource‚Äù messages:

![Jupyter notebook](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-19-58-39.png)

The `DeviceCodeCredentialOptions` approach is based on ‚Äú[Microsoft identity platform and the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow)‚Äù and provides great <acronym title="User Experience">UX</acronym> for manual/desktop applications.

The `ClientSecretCredential` approach is not recommended by [[Microsoft]] because it requires a secret generated by the [[Azure Active Directory]] app registration. Apps without a secret means using certificates? #to-do This video by [[Nick Chapsas]] probably exists because the answer to the previous question is _yes:_

Today, I set up a new key vault under <acronym title="Role-Based Access Control">RBAC</acronym> which means the **Access policies** feature is disabled:

![Azure key vault blade](../../image/day-path-2023-05-28-20-02-23.png)

The motivation to set up a new vault was based on the suspicion that the [[Azure]] kids are not handling their own breaking changes correctly‚Äîpossibly leaving older resources mysteriously non-responsive to maintenance.

This rather tedious video explains why we would want to use <acronym title="Role-Based Access Control">RBAC</acronym> over Access policies \[üìπ [watch](https://youtu.be/ojHngqXsYQc?t=627) \]:
