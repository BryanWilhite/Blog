# flippant remarks about DGML and Visual Studio code visualization

In 2008, Cameron Skinner of Microsoft wrote, “[Introduction to Directed Graph Markup Language (DGML)](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/camerons/2008/12/16/introduction-to-directed-graph-markup-language-dgml/).” In the comments of this post, [Chris Lovett](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/clovett/) is mentioned as an architect working on DGML and Sadi Khan as a Program Manager. Lovett developed [DgmlPowerTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/ChrisLovett). The last time <span class="citation">@VisualStudio</span> tweeted about DGML was [in 2017](https://twitter.com/VisualStudio/status/922944544861237249). A developer [from Turkey](https://ceyhunciper.wordpress.com/category/dgml/) developed [Visual DGML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CeyhunCiper.VisualDGML) as a Visual Studio Extension.

Because the [Class Diagram](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/class-designer/designing-and-viewing-classes-and-types?view=vs-2019) is the *other* way to visualize code in Visual Studio, I tend to group these two together. In the official documentation, these two are grouped under “[Visualize code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/visualize-code?view=vs-2019)” along with:

* [code maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/map-dependencies-across-your-solutions?view=vs-2019)
* [dependency diagrams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/create-layer-diagrams-from-your-code?view=vs-2019)

Code maps and dependency diagrams appear to be applications of DGML. These DGML applications are associated with a wealth of recommended developer practices:

* “[Use code maps to debug your applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/use-code-maps-to-debug-your-applications?view=vs-2019)”
* “[Map methods on the call stack while debugging in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/map-methods-on-the-call-stack-while-debugging-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019)”
* “[Find potential problems using code map analyzers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/find-potential-problems-using-code-map-analyzers?view=vs-2019)”

Some recommended videos:

* “[Debug visually with Code Map debugger integration](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Studio-2012-Premium-and-Ultimate-Overview/Visual-Studio-Ultimate-2012Debug-visually-with-Code-Map-debugger-integration)” (2013)
* “[Visual Studio ALM Rangers Architecture Tooling Guidance—Overview of the Guidance](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Visual-Studio-ALM-Rangers/ABEExtensionOverview?term=Visual%20Studio%20Architecture%20Tooling%20Guidance&lang-en=true)” (2011)
