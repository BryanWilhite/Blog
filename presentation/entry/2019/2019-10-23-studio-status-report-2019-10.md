# studio status report: 2019-10

## month 10 was about re-releasing this Blog

My old `Blog` [repo](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Blog) and a new `day-path` [repo](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/day-path) finally free me from the mineshaft 🐰🕳 I dug for myself filled with PHP, WordPress, [Matt Mullenweg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg)’s old socks and my over-enthusiasm for Angular. I assume that I can live the rest of my life of liberty and freedom using something like [Zach Leatherman](https://twitter.com/zachleat/)’s new socks to keep track of myself in public.

## `@songhay/index` and lunr

I am now convinced that `@songhay/index` should be a user experience for [lunr](https://lunrjs.com/). I am no longer concerned with using third-party search engines that are not exclusively concerned with returning _my_ data. Turning this piece out into the wild from my studio will directly respond to the only reason why folks need to have a database connected to their website: for search.

Work here might provide an opportunity to finally use [Angular Elements](https://angular.io/guide/elements).

## sketching out a development schedule (revision 4)

Today the studio development schedule looks like this:

* ~~get 11ty pipelines running with the FunkyKB~~ ✔
* ~~migrate Thunderbird email to new Hyper-V Ubuntu VM~~ ✔
* ~~move the kinté space blog to an 11ty pipeline (this has been another emergency *for years*)~~ ✔
* ~~update SonghaySystem.com with my new `@songhay/player-video-you-tube`~~ ✔
* ~~convert the Day Path blog to 11ty~~ 💪💡
* use `@songhay/index` as a side-car app for “Day Path” and “the rasx() context”
* convert Day Path Blog and SonghaySystem.com to HTTPs by default 🔐
* use the learnings from existing npm packages to build `@songhay/player-audio-???` 📦✨
* set up automated social-media posting with Azure logic apps (and Azure functions orchestration) ☁🤖
* modernize the kinté hits page into a progressive web app 💄✨
* use the learnings of previous work to upgrade and re-release the kinté space 🚀
