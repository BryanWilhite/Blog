# Bryan Wilhite, ‘Service-Oriented User Interface Consultant’

For 2012, my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/wilhite/) headline was ‘Silverlight Consultant’—signifying a year-long celebration of working for a Silverlight shop here in Century City, CA. I would like to grant myself the headline of ‘User Experience Consultant’—but I’m an honest person (for mental health reasons) and the truth (for me) says I’m nowhere near [Bill Buxton](http://www.billbuxton.com/).

Calling myself a consultant of *user experience* is like saying I’m an artist with the ability to deconstruct and (possibly) replicate a *Jimi Hendrix experience*. My artist chops are remarkable (and [award-winning](http://kintespace.com/rasxlog/?p=117)) but not in current practice as much as my IT technical exercising.

This personal imbalance between my art/science and my technical craft is the overarching, dominating problem of unsustainability in my life. This problem of mine is not recognizable for most people in my practice—only a guy like [Carl Franklin](http://www.franklins.net/carl.aspx) (or Bill Buxton himself) would have sympathy for my years of discomfiture.

The typical self-described “technical” person would appreciate that a headline with the name *Silverlight* in it is rather “old”—and it overlooks my decades of investment in X/HTML and CSS—and years of joyous work with jQuery. The release of [Breeze.js](http://www.breezejs.com/) (and [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/)) makes it possible for me to see end-to-end (server-to-client) conceptual equivalency between Silverlight and HTML/JavaScript. I still prefer Silverlight (for ‘extremely complex’ UI) but it’s honest and inclusive to roll my Silverlight work under the headline ‘Service-Oriented User Interface Consultant’ with my HTML-based practice.
