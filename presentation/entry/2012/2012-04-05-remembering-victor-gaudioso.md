# Remembering Victor Gaudioso

I first met Victor Gaudioso on death-march-like <acronym title="Windows Presentation Foundation">WPF</acronym> project at William O’Neil in Marina Del Rey in that brutal winter of 2010. I knew immediately he was a rock star of Expression Blend. He could assemble a user interface in Expression Blend before your eyes with the same ease as a type writer banging out business correspondence on fine stationary—and he could do this *correctly* within *minutes*.

Victor was one of the few people *in the world* outside of Microsoft that was *virtuosic* with [Expression Blend](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/expression/). Victor represents the *future* of application development which is actually very ancient—we need builders who are very technical *and* very artistic. Victor was one of those builders.
