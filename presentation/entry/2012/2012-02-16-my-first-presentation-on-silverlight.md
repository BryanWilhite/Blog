Wow! Let’s see:

*   Silverlight MVP Victor Gaudioso lost his venue in Culver City next to Sony Studios so we had to do it in his new apartment in Granada Hills.
*   Victor also lost his original speaker for 2/2012 and I was a hasty substitute.
*   I started the talk without introducing myself and went straight into an “advanced topic” without realizing that many audience members were kind of uninterested in the detail.
*   I did not show up (visually) on the live video stream (I was just a “shadow”).
*   I went way off [script](http://wordwalkingstick.com/DayPath/page/Practice-to-Portfolio-“Playing”-with-Silverlight.rasx) and did not even make it through *five*[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/rasx/practice-to-portfolio).

Nevertheless, I think I got a little better presenting towards the end of the talk. I actually have [another talk tonight](http://kintespace.com/rasxlog/?p=2745) with Dr. Shani Byard (@MessageMediaEd)—I won’t be on Silverlight let’s see how that goes.
