# studio status report: 2025-02

## month 02 of 2025 was about upgrading `Songhay.Publications` to .NET 8.0 and working directly on kintespace.com

I continue to fiddle and struggle with my Obsidian graph view of the month:

<div style="text-align:center">

![Obsidian graph for this month](../../image/day-path-2025-02-26-20-25-28.png)

</div>

I notice that most of nodes labeled with dates hover around the Songhay Publications topics of this Studio which indicates what should be obvious but is actually novel: this Studio works on Publications. It has taken easily over a decade to achieve the obvious. The release of `Songhay.Publications` release 8.0.0üì¶ [[GitHub](https://github.com/users/BryanWilhite/projects/32)] (which includes the completion of [issue #54](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Publications/issues/54), struck off below in ‚Äúsketching out development projects‚Äù) represents the last major barrier between me and the obvious.

Below, in ‚Äúsketching out development projects,‚Äù I have added and struck off the following line:

>change `Songhay.Player.YouTube` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Player.YouTube)] to support deep linking into thumb sets üî®üêé‚ú®

This change to `Songhay.Player.YouTube` occurred last month, represented by the release of the [version 8.0.1 NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Songhay.Player.YouTube/8.0.1). A rough prototype of this deep linking can be found at <https://staging.kintespace.com/b-roll/yt/set>. Importantly, this deep-linking feature makes it possible to replace the index page of kintespace.com with a more static, primal design‚Äîfinally free of an ancient JavaScript framework called Angular JS.

The bottom line is that the way forward is obvious. Selected notes from this month are below:

## [[Songhay Publications (C‚ôØ)]]: issue #54 (upgrade to [[dotnet|.NET 8.0]])

I will add the following to [issue #54](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Publications/issues/54):

It is not recommended to completely remove the `Songhay.Publications.DataAccess` project from the [[Songhay Publications - KinteSpace|kintespace.com]] repo because this repo should _apply_ `PublicationsDbContext` for the specific [[SQLite]] needs of this publication. All of the <acronym title="Entity Framework">EF</acronym> migration files and direct references to a [[SQLite]] file should be kept in the kintespace.com repo.

By moving `PublicationsDbContext` out of the kintespace.com repo, the `dotnet ef migrations add` command can no longer use the `--project` option \[üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet#common-options) \] when run from this repo. The `--context` option would be the replacement:

>The `DbContext` class to use. Class name only or fully qualified with namespaces. If this option is omitted, EF Core will find the context class. If there are multiple context classes, this option is required.
>
>‚Äî‚Äú[Common options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet#common-options)‚Äù

</div>

It is now clear to me that ‚Äòeverything‚Äô I have been working on _consistently_ in this Studio for _at least_ the last 15 years comes together in the [[Songhay Publications - KinteSpace|kintespace.com]] repo, namely all of the ‚Äòcores‚Äô:

- `SonghayCore` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore)]
- `Songhay.Modules` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Modules)]
- `Songhay.Modules.Bolero` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Modules.Bolero)]

## [[Songhay Publications - KinteSpace|kint√© space]]: ‚ÄúWhat really happens inside a dating app‚Äù

>I think that if you are a marketing person and have a bit of a shady personality, you can create a dating app that has significant revenue easily. What you have to do is to create fake girls' profiles; you don't really have to make them talk or match, just be visible on the feed. Then you make guys pay for similar things that Tinder is doing (you can just copy their plans). The best would be to communicate around being an app for sex. When a guy pays, you would just not do anything different than non-paying users. You will probably end up with 90% real guys and 10% real girls, but I would be surprised if you don't make a lot of money with that. Probably a lot of not really popular dating apps you find on the Play Store/Apple Store are just that, and that have no girls.

## [[Songhay Publications|Publications]]: ‚ÄúMinimal viable service worker‚Äù

From 2018:

>The thing is, every website is different. So the service worker strategy for every website needs to be different too.
>
>Still, I was wondering if it would be possible to create a service worker script that would work for _most_ websites. [Here‚Äôs the script I came up with](https://gist.github.com/adactio/3717b7da007a9363ddf21f584aae34af).
>
>‚Äî‚Äú[Minimal viable service worker](https://adactio.com/journal/13540)‚Äù
>

Is this the kind of investigation that led to [[Google Workbox]] (noted [[2024-12-06#Google Google Workbox promises to make browser-based caching easy and useful ‚ùì to-do day-job|previously]])? In spite of what [[Google]] is doing, here is another article from 2024 yearning for ‚Äúminimum interesting service worker‚Äù:

>Basic idea:
>
>You have a service worker (and ‚Äúoffline‚Äù HTML page) on your personal site, installed from any page on your site, that all it does is cache the offline page, and on future requests to your site checks to see if the requested page is available, and if so serves it, otherwise it displays your offline page with a ‚Äúsite appears to be unreachable‚Äù message that a lot of service workers provide, AND provides an algorithmically constructed link to the page on an archive (e.g. Internet Archive) or static mirror of your site (typically at another domain).

## [[dotnet|.NET]] `System.Threading.Channels`

>The [System.Threading.Channels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.channels) namespace provides a set of synchronization data structures for passing data between producers and consumers asynchronously. The library targets .NET Standard and works on all .NET implementations.

## [[Songhay Player - YouTube (F‚ôØ)]]: caching with service workers will help _after_ initial loading ‚è±üëÄ

My [[2024-12-06#Google Google Workbox promises to make browser-based caching easy and useful ‚ùì to-do day-job|previous]] note about the [[Google]] approach to service workers \[üìñ [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers) \] can servcei to remind me that a fundamental use case of service workers is caching‚Äîand caching is what [[Songhay Player - YouTube (F‚ôØ)|the b-roll player for YouTube üé• content]] seriously needs.

In order to address the problem of initial loading, I prioritized finding a service-based way toward caching. But in the particular design of [[Songhay Publications - KinteSpace|kintespace.com]] there _should_ be a static-<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> based ‚Äòsplash‚Äô page that should be loaded _before_ the player. This convention suggests that most visitors will discover the player from this ‚Äòsplash‚Äô page‚Äîthis means the ‚Äòsplash‚Äô page can call a service worker to cache the data for the player.

>[!important]
>The ‚Äòsplash‚Äô page can call a service worker to cache the data for the player.

This convention implies that this Studio should not encourage ‚Äúdeep linking‚Äù directly to the player(s).

## [[WebAssembly]]: ‚ÄúRust is Eating JavaScript‚Äù

>[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/)¬†(WASM) is a portable low-level language that Rust can compile to. It runs in the browser, is interoperable with JavaScript, and is supported in all major modern browsers.
>
>> WASM is definitely a lot faster than JS, but not quite native speed. In our tests, Parcel runs 10-20x slower when compiled to WASM than with native binaries. ‚Äì [Devon Govett](https://twitter.com/devongovett)
>
>While WASM isn't the perfect solution yet, it _can_ help developers create extremely fast web experiences. The Rust team is [committed](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm) to a high-quality and cutting-edge WASM implementation. For developers, this means you could have the performance advantages of Rust (vs. Go) while still compiling for the web (using WASM).

## [[Songhay Publications - KinteSpace|the kint√© space]] repos are now working together

The ‚Äòlegacy‚Äô repo, `kinte-space`, is positioned to maintain the current kintespace.com under <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure">HTTPS</acronym> and the new repo, `Songhay.Publications.KinteSpace`, recognizes the existence of `staging.kintespace.com`, representing the next version of kintespace.com. It is [[2025-02-03#next steps|now ready]] to move forward:

- generating Publication indices from SQLite for the kintespace.com static index experience
  - ~~build~~ describe  an [[Songhay Activity|Activity]] that generates existing `data/index*.json` files üöú‚ú® ‚úÖ
  - attempt to load `data/index*.json` files with `eleventyConfig.addGlobalData` üî®‚ú® \[üìñ [docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global-custom/) \]
  - change the Activity that generates existing `data/index*.json` files to generate ‚Äòdefaults‚Äô for `Document.ResponsiveImages` üî®üñº‚ú®
  - use [[eleventy]] to generate `app-staging/index.html` with `data/index*.json` üî®üç±‚ú®
  - copy all images from the legacy repo (`app/images`) üöú
  - change eleventy template for `app-staging/index.html` to add:
    - [[Songhay Player - YouTube (F‚ôØ)]] deep link to thumb set üî®üêé‚ú®
    - `lunr` search  üî®üç±‚ú®  (==not needed for initial re-release==)
    - [[Songhay Publications Index (F‚ôØ)]] linküî®üêé‚ú®
- generating a new repo for [[Songhay Publications Index (F‚ôØ)]] with proposed name, `Songhay.Modules.Bolero.Index` ‚ú®üöß and add a GitHub Project (==not needed for initial re-release==)
- building the eleventy template for `kp_*.html` files üî®üç±‚ú®
- building the eleventy template for `p_*.html` files üî®üç±‚ú®
- building the eleventy template for `rasx*.html` files üî®üç±‚ú®
- migrating [[Songhay Publications - KinteSpace|rasx() context]] content from its legacy repo to `app-staging/rasxlog/` üöú

This is pretty much >90% of kintespace.com content.

## [[dotnet|.NET]]: AutoFixture ‚ú® #to-do

From <https://autofixture.github.io/>:

>AutoFixture is a tool designed to make Test-Driven Development more productive and unit tests more refactoring-safe. It does so by removing the need for hand-coding anonymous variables as part of a test‚Äôs Arrange phase:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void IntroductoryTest()
{
    // Arrange
    Fixture fixture = new Fixture();

    int expectedNumber = fixture.Create<int>();
    MyClass sut = fixture.Create<MyClass>();
    // Act
    int result = sut.Echo(expectedNumber);
    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(expectedNumber, result);
}
```

The `AutoData` feature for the `Theory` attribute is interesting:

```csharp
[Theory, AutoData]

{
    int result = sut.Echo(expectedNumber);
    Assert.Equal(expectedNumber, result);
}
