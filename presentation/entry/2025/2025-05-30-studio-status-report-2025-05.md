# studio status report: 2025-05

## month 05 of 2025 was about discovering the essential ‚Äòboundary-crossing abstractions‚Äô and rewriting `Songhay.Player` for the last time, really

My discovery this month was so important to me that I actually broke the fourth wall and [posted](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wilhite_hey-people-it-is-old-guy-manifesto-activity-7332515716329349121-Gd4t?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAADEJ_ABMWbhfBWE7JW6GvOyg5pLa5zVK-Q) _my words_ from my personal journal on LinkedIn:

<div style="text-align:center">

![personal journal entry](../../image/day-path-2025-05-30-21-31-04.png)

</div>

The five abstractions mentioned above (excluding `IConfiguration` because that abstraction is from Microsoft) will be in the next release of `SonghayCore` [üîó [GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore)]. How big is this realization? For the first ime in my life, I can refer to myself as an _architect_ which is a great, sincere feeling because I am not getting any younger üòêüßì

These new abstractions are temporarily lodging in my b-roll server project `Songhay.Player`. I am counting 16 days in the Obsidian graph view that were dedicated to Songhay Player (C‚ôØ) (`Songhay.Player`) and these novel abstractions:

<div style="text-align:center">

![Obsidian graph view](../../image/day-path-2025-05-30-21-38-42.png)

</div>

16 days of _epic_ re-factoring!

In ‚Äúsketching out development projects‚Äù below there is the following line item:

- replace current b-roll player API with Azure Functions

The 16 days of epic re-factoring will address this line item, royally. In fact, these 16 days will inform how I build enterprise systems for the rest of my life. Having these new abstractions does _not_ mean I know ‚Äúeverything‚Äù‚Äîit means I know the essentials, the rock-solid fundamentals. Here is [an article from 2003 by Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html) talking about the repository pattern, so I ‚Äòshould‚Äô have known this earlier, right? Not really. First of all, there is a difference between the repository pattern and the _generic_ repository pattern. This list of ingredients that inspired me are not hanging low from the proverbial trees:

- the recent release of _keyed_ dependencies from Microsoft [üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services)] (this lack of keys probably explains why the other, non-Microsoft DI frameworks are still in use)
- being made aware of the _generic_ repository pattern by a kid from the current day job
- my relatively new, healthy lack of respect for integration testing‚Äîsuch massive disrespect is made possible by well-placed, mockable, boundary-crossing abstractions (and new understanding of the role Jupyter Notebooks play)
- the idea of using domain-specific extension methods with a generic (domain-non-specific) repository (this idea came the fastest because of my fondness for extension methods)
- my inexperience, lack of industry role models and lack of critical thinking skills that delayed me seeing why `HttpRequestMessage` needs to be ‚Äòhidden‚Äô behind an abstraction
- the awkward starts and stops of Microsoft‚Äôs Entity Framework teams that eventually developed a `DbContext` type that not that far removed from a plain-old CLR object (POCO)
- my time wasted being dragged through at least two very, very different Azure Storage SDKs that finally prompted me to employ a REST-based approach to Azure Storage (which then had to be ‚Äòhidden‚Äô behind an abstraction)
- the innovation of generics themselves which did not appear in Java (deformed) much, much later (and Java culture influences .NET people in useful and not-so-useful ways)
- general cognitive load bearing down on me from a myriad of places that have nothing to do with exploring Domain Driven Design

None of the remarks listed above appeared my notes this month. I may write (or actually _speak_) about such things later. In the meantime, selections, from my Studio notes for this month, follow:

## [[Songhay Core (C‚ôØ)]]: why can I not de-serialize `ProgramMetadataExtensions`? üòê

It was because I defined `ProgramMetadata` with read-only properties:

```csharp
public Dictionary<string, DbmsMetadata> DbmsSet { get; } = new();
```

‚Ä¶de-serialization now works because of this:

```csharp
public Dictionary<string, DbmsMetadata> DbmsSet { get; init; } = new();
```

>The `init` keyword defines an _accessor_ method in a property or indexer. An init-only setter assigns a value to the property or the indexer element **only** during object construction. An `init` enforces immutability, so that once the object is initialized, it can't be changed. An `init` accessor enables calling code to use an [object initializer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-initialize-objects-by-using-an-object-initializer) to set the initial value. As a contrast, an [automatically implemented property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties) with only a `get` setter must be initialized by calling a constructor.

## [[Azure Functions]]: ‚ÄúMigrate C# apps from the in-process model to the isolated worker model‚Äù üòêüò≤ #day-job

I had no idea! I had to be shown this:

>[Support for the in-process model ends on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you migrate your apps to the isolated worker model by following the instructions in this article.

I would be awesome to find that all I have to do is swap my ‚Äú[core packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-in-process-differences#execution-model-comparison-table)‚Äù:

![core packages](../../image/day-path-2025-05-30-22-28-56.png)

**Update:** the bulk of the changes were indeed [[NuGet]] packages with some very weird exceptions:

<div style="text-align:center">

>[!important]
>The docs fail to mention that, in addition to `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http.AspNetCore`, the `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http` package is required.

## [[Songhay Player: YouTube]]: yes, this `etag` thing has been real üòê

The `Get-CloudYtChannelsList` command of the YouTube channel maintenance procedure can be modified to collect upload `etag` information which can be used to skip unchanged uploads #to-do There are about 630 [[YouTube]] channels under curation. A little over 500 of them are changing weekly.

## [[dotnet|.NET 8.0]]: yes, ‚Äú.NET regular expression source generators‚Äù will require your class to become `partial`

>.NET 7 introduced a new `RegexGenerator` source generator. A _source generator_ is a component that plugs into the compiler and augments the compilation unit with additional source code. The .NET SDK (version 7 and later) includes a source generator that recognizes the [GeneratedRegexAttribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.regularexpressions.generatedregexattribute) ==attribute on a partial method== that returns `Regex`. The source generator provides an implementation of that method that contains all the logic for the `Regex`.
>
>‚Äî‚Äú[.NET regular expression source generators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-source-generators)‚Äù
>

Because this brave new world of `RegexGenerator` depends on a partial method, the `class` containing this method must be made partial:

>When a method declaration includes a `partial` modifier, that method is said to be a _**partial method**_. Partial methods may only be declared as members of partial types ([¬ß15.2.7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/classes#1527-partial-type-declarations)), and are subject to a number of restrictions.
>
>‚Äî‚Äú[15.6.9 Partial methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/classes#1569-partial-methods)‚Äù
>

I was thrown into this news when I accepted a re-factoring hint from [[JetBrains Rider]] which gave me the `GeneratedRegex` on line 134:

<div style="text-align:center">

## [[dotnet|.NET 8.0]]: the importance of `JsonValue.Create` in [[Songhay Publications (C‚ôØ)]] üòêü•∂

I am unable to explain why the unit test, `MarkdownEntryExtensionsTests.WithNew11tyFrontMatterAndContentHeaderAndTouch_Test`, is now passing. But the change to make things work is this:

```csharp
i.FrontMatter["modificationDate"] = JsonValue.Create(date);
```

‚Ä¶which used to be this:

```csharp
i.FrontMatter["modificationDate"] = date.ToIso8601String();
```

The old statement caused an exception with the message:

```console
A value of type 'System.String' cannot be converted to a 'System.DateTime'.
```

‚Ä¶which made me think that Microsoft‚Äôs `GetValue<T>` was fundamentally flawed. Meanwhile, there was hint in [[JetBrains Rider]] that led me to `JsonValue.Create`:

<div style="text-align:center">

![JetBrains hint](../../image/day-path-2025-05-30-22-36-06.png)

</div>

```console
Implicit conversion of 'date.ToIso8601String()' from 'string' to 'JsonNode?' 
```

It is very likely that the ‚Äúimplicit conversion‚Äù generates a `JsonNode` of `JsonValueKind.String` with no ‚Äòunderstanding‚Äô that this string is a ‚Äòdate string.‚Äô

Superficially, `JsonValue.Create(date)` should be identical to `date.ToIso8601String()`. In both cases the node is of `JsonValueKind.String`‚Äîin fact, `JsonValue.Create(date).GetValueKind()` is of `JsonValueKind.String` üòê Somebody is hiding the secret sauce from me ü•∂

Okay, here is one more clue:

## [[Selenium WebDriver]]: there may not be a need to run Web-driver tests from conventional test projects üòêüß†üí° #day-job

When I see a line of code like this:

```csharp
chromeDriver.Navigate().GoToUrl("https://localhost:7082");
```

‚Ä¶ the `"https://localhost:7082"` jumps out at me‚Äîit is effectively saying, ‚ÄúI am an external process that can be run from anywhere‚Äù‚Äîanywhere like a [[Jupyter|Jupyter Notebook]] üí°

## [[Azure Functions]]: when did the `[Blob]` attribute appear on the scene? üë¥üòê #make-blog-post

Too many demos and docs highlight `[BlobTrigger]` \[üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger) \] instead of `[Blob]`‚Äîlikely because of historical reasons as the former appeared well before the latter. This video from four years ago _properly_ introduces the `[Blob]` attribute (to me):

## [[Songhay Player (C‚ôØ)]]: the (obvious) need found for `GetPropertyJsonNodeOrNull` üòêü§ì

Today, there remains two #to-do items:

<div style="text-align:center">

![Rider TODO items view](../../image/day-path-2025-05-30-22-42-21.png)

</div>

The discovery of this need came from seeing (again) the obvious. This will fail:

```csharp
return jObject  
    .GetPropertyJsonObjectOrNull("snippet")  
    .GetPropertyJsonObjectOrNull("publishedAt")?  
    .GetValue<DateTime>();
```

‚Ä¶this will not:

```csharp
return jObject  
    .GetPropertyJsonObjectOrNull("snippet")  
    .GetPropertyJsonNodeOrNull("publishedAt", logger)?  
    .GetValue<DateTime>();
```

The `publishedAt` property does _not_ represent an object üòê

## [[Blender]] has a default (?) color space

[BT.709](https://www.color.org/chardata/rgb/BT709.xalter) is the color space, according to the following video:

## [[Angular]]: ‚ÄúYou're misunderstanding DDD in Angular (and Frontend)‚Äù

Brutal. Autodidact talking to code camp graduates:

>All in all, there's a growing¬†[semantic diffusion](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html?ref=angularspace.com)¬†within frontend communities about DDD and it's bringing more harm than good (in short,¬†_semantic diffusion_¬†happens when people use a term without understanding it and, within some time, the meaning gets derailed ‚òπÔ∏è).
>
>‚Ä¶
>
>DDD is a methodology that's rather easy to cover just the main topics and building blocks (see:¬†_DDD at a glance_¬†section below).

## [[dotnet|.NET]]: when the output from one test can be the input for another test, do _not_ immediately build an ordered test üòêüß†üí° #dotnet-architecture

‚Ä¶ Instead chaining one test to another üî¨üîóüî¨, we should build _decoupled_ (unit) tests:

>[!important]
>The output of one test can be used as hand-curated input ‚úãü¶ã for another test. This curation process should be considered ‚Äúpart of the job‚Äù‚Äîactually maintaining an app like a professional (instead of an animal). This curation decouples one test from another‚Äîand is my explanation as to why [[JetBrains Rider]] does _not_ support ordered tests.
>

Again, I have to celebrate [[Object Dumper]] which makes this curation process far easier‚Äîespecially with legacy spaghetti üçùüë¥

## [[Songhay Player (C‚ôØ)]]: I think the final piece to the puzzle is `IApiRequestStrategy` üòê‚ùì #dotnet-architecture

My previous concerns about the removal of `Uri`-building parameters from `I*ApiEndpoint` contracts has been addressed with `IApiRequestStrategy.GenerateHttpRequestMessage()`. This will make centralizing all of the <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> requests possible (perhaps with `Dictionary<string, IApiRequestStrategy>`?) via some kind of Provider for <acronym title="Dependency Injection">DI</acronym>.

`IApiRequestStrategy` externalizes the generation of `HttpRequestMessage` which reduces the uniqueness of all implementations of `I*ApiEndpoint` contracts‚Äîthese implementations would be distinguished by `ResiliencePipeline` going forward which makes them more <acronym title="Dependency Injection">DI</acronym> ‚Äòfriendly.‚Äô

`IApiRequestStrategy` has the suffix Strategy because I am under the impression that I am using the [Strategy Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy/csharp/example).

## [[Songhay Player (C‚ôØ)]]: `IApiEndpoint` and `IApiRequestStrategy` depend on each other üòê

Both of these contracts have one member, respectively:

```csharp
Task<string> DownloadStringAsync(IApiRequestStrategy requestStrategy, string? path);
```

```csharp
HttpRequestMessage GenerateHttpRequestMessage(string? path);
```

>[!important]
>`IApiEndpoint.DownloadStringAsync` passes `string? path` through to `IApiRequestStrategy.GenerateHttpRequestMessage`.

This ‚Äòcoupling‚Äô is by design‚Äîmy design‚Äîand it feels like a hack. The problem starts with this first question:

>[!question]
>What happens when I want my ‚Äúrequest strategy‚Äù to be based on a `Uri`?
>

‚Ä¶which leads to other unpleasant-but-valid questions:

- Are you suggesting that a `Uri` is _not_ the default ‚Äúrequest strategy‚Äù?
- Why are no generics involved here?
- What do you mean by pass though?

I think generics should be involved here:

```csharp
Task<string> DownloadStringAsync<TItem>(IApiRequestStrategy requestStrategy, TItem? requestItem);
```

```csharp
HttpRequestMessage GenerateHttpRequestMessage<TItem>(TItem? requestItem);
```

Yuck. What kind of name is `requestItem`?

```csharp
Task<string> DownloadStringAsync<TData>(IApiRequestStrategy requestStrategy, TData? requestData);
```

```csharp
HttpRequestMessage GenerateHttpRequestMessage<TData>(TData? requestData);
```

‚Ä¶only slightly better.

>[!warning]
>The use of generic type arguments in an interface forces the implementer to check for types.  

## [[Entity Framework]]: the Generic Async Repository has been around since before 2019‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs time to catch up! ‚Äú[Repository Pattern ‚Äì Generic Async Repositories in C#](https://blog.zhaytam.com/2019/03/14/generic-repository-pattern-csharp/)‚Äù is proof that this idea has been around since before 2019. My motivation for (finally) introducing this idea into my Studio includes:

- the desire to define and centralize CRUD operations for [[Entity Framework|Entity Framework Core]]
- providing the generic repository abstraction, `IGenericRepository<T, TKey>`, that can be specialized via extension methods for specific applications

>[!important]
>The default implementation of `IGenericRepository<T, TKey>` needs a `DbContext` in order to construct. `DbContext` is the base class of _all_ [[Entity Framework|Entity Framework Core]] applications.

I have prepared a new, quick-and-dirty release of [[Songhay Data Access (C‚ôØ)]] under [issue #14](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.DataAccess/issues/14) #to-do to address this ‚Äòdiscovery‚Äô üòê

## [[FFmpeg]]: `typed-ffmpeg` might help me write [[Jupyter|Jupyter Notebooks]] for video processing üòêüé• #to-do

>**typed-ffmpeg** offers a modern, Pythonic interface to FFmpeg, providing extensive support for complex filters with detailed typing and documentation.

## [[dotnet|.NET]]: that time I asked about the `>>` operator of F‚ôØ üòê‚ùì

This [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71578086/22944) pretty much answered my question:

‚Ä¶this:

```fsharp
PizzaConfigMsg >> dispatch
```

‚Ä¶is the same as this:

```fsharp
fun pizzaMsg -> pizzaMsg |> PizzaConfigMsg |> dispatch
```

>This tells us that the code is converting a value of type `PizzaConfigMsg` (which I've called `pizzaMsg` above) to a top-level `Message` via the `Message.PizzaConfigMsg` union case, then dispatching the result.

>This style of coding (where function arguments become implicit, rather than explicit) is called "point-free programming". You can find more information about it [here](https://blog.jayway.com/2012/05/08/point-free-programming-style-in-f/).

## sketching out development projects

Eliminating Angular JS in the Studio is the top priority. Replacing the Angular JS app (`http://kintespace.com/player.html`) for the kint√© space depends on:

- generating a new `index.html` page with eleventy
- supplementing the index with responsive images

Proposed future items:

- complete upgrade to .NET 8.0
- replace current b-roll player API with Azure Functions
- switch Studio Publications from Material Design to Bulma üíÑ ‚û°Ô∏è üíÑ‚ú®
- start `Songhay.Modules.Bolero.Index` project
- generate responsive and social images with AI
