# studio status report: 2025-06

## month 06 of 2025 was about releasing the b-roll player <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>

Month 06 of 2025 was about releasing the b-roll player <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> in Microsoft Azure, solidifying the architectural practice of this Studio as this release features:

- the premiere use of Microsoft‚Äôs `HttpTriggerAttribute.Route` \[üîó [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/blob/ba0f4dc6e0318af9a493198179dc46a29afb7e57/extensions/Worker.Extensions.Http/src/HttpTriggerAttribute.cs#L59) \] attribute for endpoints which allows me to match routes already set up on the legacy Player <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>
- the premiere use of Microsoft‚Äôs keyed <acronym title="Dependency Injection">DI</acronym> which is new to dotnet|.NET 8.0
- the keyed injection of Activities into Functions classes which formally define the ‚Äòtree‚Äô of inputs and outputs of the domain
- the premiere use of the new ‚Äòboundary-crossing‚Äô abstractions of this Studio (e.g. `IApiEndpoint` \[üîó [GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/main/SonghayCore/Abstractions/IApiEndpoint.cs) \]) which still find quite revolutionary-but-not-at-all-glamorous at the moment (more detail is in [last month‚Äôs report](https://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/entry/2025-05-30-studio-status-report-2025-05/))
- the premiere use of `IConfiguration` as a form of input, causing the new Studio convention of `*ShellActivity` Activities which are concerned with reading command-line input

This API release allows me to make the claim I made over two months ago true: this Studio is in a ready state to focus on building for the front end. Two months ago [my notes referenced](https://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/entry/2025-04-29-studio-status-report-2025-04/) this Pen: <https://codepen.io/rasx/pen/raNbNwx> This Pen represents the push toward replacing the old-ass Angular JS (and, yes, I mean Angular _JS_) home splash for kintespace.com with a splash based on eleventy. Ideally, more to come‚Ä¶

According to the Obsidian Graph View, only five days were spent on the b-roll player API:

<div style="text-align:center">

![Obsidian Graph View (detail)](../../image/day-path-2025-06-29-18-49-55.png)

</div>

This is down from the ‚Äòepic‚Äô 16 days used up [last month](https://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/entry/2025-05-30-studio-status-report-2025-05/) which is understandable as the front end concerns emerge. Speaking of which, here are the NuGet packages released by this Studio for month 06:

- `Songhay.Publications` 8.0.3 \[üîó [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Songhay.Publications/8.0.3) \]
- `SonghayCore` 8.0.2 \[üîó [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SonghayCore/8.0.2) \]

These releases were needed to support the dependencies of the Player API.

The following selected notes should show a month of front-end awareness and maybe a little day-job concern:

## .NET: ‚ÄúAnnouncing dotnet run app.cs ‚Äì A simpler way to start with C# and .NET 10‚Äù

>[!question]
>Is this is a replacement for C‚ôØ scripting?

>Until now, executing C# code using the `dotnet` CLI required a project structure that included a `.csproj` file. With this new capability, which we call _file-based apps_, you can run a standalone `.cs` file directly, much like you would with scripting languages such as Python or JavaScript.
>
>This lowers the entry barrier to trying out C# and makes the language a much more attractive choice for learning, prototyping, or automation scenarios.

## .NET: `json-everything` extension method #to-do

The `IsEquivalentTo` method \[üîó [link](https://github.com/json-everything/json-everything/blob/43edec29bab368bbd53a4938993318612643aae8/src/Json.More/JsonElementExtensions.cs#L24C21-L24C35) \] is interesting and leads to questions like:

- does it use `ToList` for performance reasons or just out of habit?
- will it work with `ToArray`?
- can it be modified to record/store the location/values of the diff?

## Microsoft SQL Server: `HierarchyId` has been around since 2008 #day-job

>The [hierarchyid](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/hierarchyid-data-type-method-reference?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5003978) type was introduced with SQL Server 2008. This type is used to represent and manipulate hierarchical data. Hierarchical data contain the notion of parent/child but also the notion of order between elements having the same parent. Values ‚Äã‚Äãof this type are stored in a binary form, for example, `0x5AC0` or `0x58`, but in practice, we use character strings of the type `'/'` for the root or `'/1/'` for a child of the root node‚Ä¶

## Finance: tech layoffs from a change in tax law?

>Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code governs the tax treatment of research and development (R&D) expenditures. For roughly 70 years, American companies could deduct 100% of ‚Äúqualified research and development spending‚Äù in the year they incurred the costs, and this was generally interpreted pretty liberally. Salaries, software, contractor payments‚Ä¶ if it contributed to creating or improving a product, it could be deducted ‚Äúoff the top‚Äù of a firm‚Äôs taxable income. The [deduction was](https://www.thetaxadviser.com/issues/2024/jun/rights-for-the-research-development-credit-and-sec-174/#:~:text=Originally%20enacted%20in%201954%2C%20Sec,product%20development%20expenses%20under%20Sec.) originally codified by Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954, and under the provision, R&D flourished in the U.S. It gave us the dominance of Bell Labs, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook - pretty much all the US technology booms you‚Äôve lived through unless you‚Äôre quire venerable.

## Songhay Player (C‚ôØ): the thinnest ‚Äòcontrollers‚Äô ever üòê

The following seems so obvious now that it all comes together:

<div style="text-align:center">

![Azure Functions class](../../image/day-path-2025-06-29-19-15-46.png)

</div>

Here are some initial observations:

- my Activity concept makes a thin ‚Äòcontroller‚Äô (just two lines of code per endpoint)‚Äîand these Activities can also be used in other contexts like the command line (by calling these Activities shown above from a dedicated `*ShellActivity` class which knows how to read `IConfiguration` stuff)‚Äîor even something as old-fashioned as a Windows Service
- the ‚Äòart form‚Äô around building an Activity class is to not hide long-running operations in massive `for` loops which would make lowest-cost Azure Functions fall over under the hidden weight
- keyed services via <acronym title="Dependency Injection">DI</acronym> is new to .NET 8.0, making this one of many things we had to wait for from Microsoft
- the fundamental use case for Azure Functions (not particularly celebrated by Microsoft these days) is as a direct (serverless) replacement for ASP.NET Web API
- I am sure David Fowler‚Äôs .NET Aspire would have made building this better(?)/faster(?) but, at the moment, I remain ignorant of the benefits (when I somehow have several ‚Äúmicro-services‚Äù to deal with instead of _one_ Functions App, I will look forward to .NET Aspire)

## Publications: ‚ÄúCSS Color Functions‚Äù

>sRGB has been a standard color space for the web¬†[since 1996](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html). However, it‚Äôs closer to how old computers represented color, rather than how humans understand it, so it had some problems like¬†not being able to capture the full gamut of modern screens. Still, many modern applications and websites use sRGB, so even though it is the ‚Äúold way‚Äù of doing things, it is still widely accepted and used today.

## sketching out development projects

Eliminating Angular JS in the Studio is the top priority. Replacing the Angular JS app (`http://kintespace.com/player.html`) for the kint√© space depends on:

- generating a new `index.html` page with eleventy
- supplementing the index with responsive images

Proposed future items:

- complete upgrade to .NET 8.0
- replace current b-roll player API with Azure Functions
- switch Studio Publications from Material Design to Bulma üíÑ ‚û°Ô∏è üíÑ‚ú®
- start `Songhay.Modules.Bolero.Index` project
- generate responsive and social images with AI
