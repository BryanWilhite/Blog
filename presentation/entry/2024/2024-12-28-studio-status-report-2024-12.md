# studio status report: 2024-12

## month 12 of 2024 was about upgrading the F‚ôØ package stacks to .NET 8.0, upgrading Songhay Web Components to Lit 3.x and getting sick while on #day-job vacation

The Obsidian notes for this month should reflect slogging through the unpleasant process of upgrading Lit for Songhay Web Components [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-web-components)]. This upgrade would go into the JavaScript bundle that would back the new homepage for kintespace.com. The Obsidian Graph View for the month shows how Lit [[GitHub](https://github.com/lit/lit)] work pops up to the left of the massive Azure node:

![Obsidian Graph View for the month](../../image/day-path-2024-12-28-12-49-20.png)

![Obsidian Graph View for the month with Lit highlighted](../../image/day-path-2024-12-28-12-49-53.png)

![Obsidian Graph View for the month with Songhay Web Components highlighted](../../image/day-path-2024-12-28-12-51-14.png)

The graph is _not_ showing any direct relationship between Lit and Songhay Web Components which means there is still a lot for me to learn about data visualization as a way of life. It must also be said that the Obsidian is seeing Lit for the first time this month which is an indicator of poor time management and greed. I think I am promising myself to streamline my interests/investments‚Äîwhich should be shown in the Obsidian graph over time.

In the mean time, back to slogging through selected Obsidian notes:

## [[Anaconda]]: ‚ÄúCan I make conda solve this environment faster?‚Äù

When [[Anaconda|conda]] is hanging, trying to ‚Äúsolve the environment,‚Äù one or more of the following may be evident:

- ‚Äútoo many‚Äù packages are installed in one environment
- all of the packages are too old, having breaking changes
- `conda` itself is out of date and is encountering breaking changes with ‚Äòsources‚Äô

This video introduces the `OverloadResolutionPriority` attribute \[üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.compilerservices.overloadresolutionpriorityattribute?view=net-9.0) \] as described in ‚Äú[Understanding OverloadResolutionPriority attribute in C# 13](https://www.meziantou.net/understanding-overloadresolutionpriority-attribute-in-csharp-13.htm).‚Äù

## [[Songhay Web Components]]: working with [[Lit]] latest

In order for decorators like `@property` to compile in [[Typescript]], two `compilerOptions` \[üìñ [docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html#compiler-options) \] properties need to be set in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "useDefineForClassFields": false,
  }
}
```

For more details, see ‚Äú[Using decorators with TypeScript](https://lit.dev/docs/components/decorators/#decorators-typescript)‚Äù üìñ

## [[Typescript]]: the `as` keyword is a _type assertion_‚Äînot type casting ‚ö°üß†

In ‚Äú[TypeScript's `as` keyword might not be what you think](https://dev.to/typescriptteatime/typescripts-as-keyword-might-not-be-what-you-think-2bpo)‚Äù we have:

>‚Ä¶TypeScript's `as MyType` only changes _compile time_ behavior. It's like saying to the compiler "Compiler, believe me. This is a `MyType`. So stop complaining." Nothing has changed for the resulting JavaScript code after compiling. In other words, we're still completely vulnerable at _runtime_. That's why TypeScript actually uses the term _Type Assertion_ \[instead\] of _Type Casting_.

>[!important]
>Use the `in` ‚Äútype guard‚Äù \[üìñ [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in) \] to verify that a type assertion is correct.

>The `in` keyword in JavaScript and TypeScript checks whether a property exists on an object. In the above example, we use it to check whether the `addLemon` property exists on the `hotBeverage` object _at compile time and at runtime_. If it does, TypeScript know it's a `Tea` because the other option `Coffee` does not have an `addLemon` property. On the other hand, if the object does not have an `addLemon` property it must be `Coffee`. Unlike `as`, since `in` is a JavaScript keyword it acts at runtime, too.

## [[hardware]]: I have not written a note about [[Clonezilla]] since before 2018 üòê

## [[Songhay Web Components]]: `typedocOptions` have changed‚ùì

Here are the current‚Äîapparently old‚Äîoptions in `packages/input-autocomplete/tsconfig.json`:

        "exclude": "**/*.spec.ts",
        "excludeExternals": true,

    }
```

```

## [[Songhay Web Components]]: yes, `typedocOptions` have changed üòê

According to the traditional, bad-design foresight of the JavaScript-kiddie world, there are copious breaking changes for `typedocOptions` \[üìñ [docs](https://typedoc.org/api/interfaces/Configuration.TypeDocOptions.html) \].

Following up the previously noted state, we need to go from this:

```json
    "typedocOptions": {
        "entryPoint": "./src/input-autocomplete.ts",
        "exclude": "**/*.spec.ts",
        "excludeExternals": true,
        "inputFiles": "./src",
        "mode": "modules",
        "out": "../../docs/input-autocomplete",
        "readme": "none",
        "stripInternal": true
    }
```

‚Ä¶to this:

```json
    "typedocOptions": {
        "entryPoints": ["./src/input-autocomplete.ts"],
        "exclude": ["**/*.spec.ts"],
        "excludeExternals": true,
        "out": "../../docs/input-autocomplete",
        "readme": "none"
    }
```

I am guessing (because the docs do not support multiple versions) that `inputFiles` and `mode` have been deprecated in favor of reading the rest of the `tsconfig.json` file (instead of reinventing the wheel üé°‚ú®). This guess comes from [a GitHub comment](https://github.com/TypeStrong/TypeDoc/issues/1469#issuecomment-761591092) that explains what happened to `stripInternal`:

>`stripInternal` is a TypeScript option ([https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#stripInternal](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#stripInternal)). In 0.20, TypeDoc dropped support for setting TypeScript options via TypeDoc config files.

## [[Songhay System Studio]]: ‚ÄúThe death of the stubborn developer‚Äù

>One problem is that the circuit that lets junior developers grow into senior developers is broken or at least damaged.

## [[Songhay System Studio]]: first pass at advice for beginner Web developers

In response to this potentially fake LinkedIn message:

Learn by doing‚Äîand do this _independently_ of the company you might be working for. That means having your own GitHub repo which should be shown/mentioned during or before interviews. Also, you should use something like <https://codepen.io/> and <https://stackblitz.com> to self-teach and self-promote.

Regardless of your preference for React, use MDN, <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/>, as a neutral reference for ‚Äúpure‚Äù CSS and HTML and start casually reading sites like <https://css-tricks.com/>.

In order to invest in a solid understanding of JavaScript for the client and the eventually the server, read _JavaScript: The Good Parts: The Good Parts_ by Douglas Crockford (he also has lectures on YouTube).

Because I could not find a ‚ÄòDouglas Crockford‚Äô-like guru for Node.js, I started my own, self-teaching repo, <https://github.com/BryanWilhite/nodejs>. I recommend you do the same.

Feel free to write me any questions.

## [[dotnet|.NET]]: for default implementations of `ILogger`, use the term _debug_ instead of the word _verbose_ #day-job 

When faced with the potential problem of gigantic logs because of their verbosity for a default [[Generic Host|.NET Generic Host]], consider the following:

- replace `ILogger` calls to `LogInformation` with `LogDebug` calls 
- replace `ILogger` calls to `LogWarning` with `LogDebug("Warning:‚Ä¶")` calls
- replace `ILogger` calls to `LogError` with `LogDebug("Error:‚Ä¶")` calls
- add an overload with a `LogLevel` argument for any `ILogger` extension methods in order to support `LogDebug` (and maybe `LogTrace`)
- ensure that you have a production-ready `appSettings.json` file with something like the following:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

>The `LogLevel` specifies the minimum [level](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging?tabs=command-line#log-level) to log for selected categories. ‚Ä¶`LogLevel` indicates the severity of the log and ranges from 0 to 6:
>
>`Trace` = 0, `Debug` = 1, `Information` = 2, `Warning` = 3, `Error` = 4, `Critical` = 5, and `None` = 6.
>
>‚Äî‚Äú[Logging in C# and .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging?tabs=command-line)‚Äù
>

>[!important]
>Dropping a copious amount of `LogInformation` calls ‚Äòdown‚Äô to `LogDebug` calls, with the `appSettings.json`, `"Logging"` setting shown above, ensures that _verbosity_ will be eliminated in harmony with the defaults coming from [[Microsoft]].

## [[Songhay Core (C‚ôØ)]]: add an overload, `isCommandLineSwitch` to `HasArg` extension method üî®‚ú®

Add `isCommandLineSwitch` to support args like:

- `--dry-run=true`
- `--dry-run=false`

‚Ä¶such that `--dry-run=false` will make `HasArg` return `false` and `--dry-run=true` will make `HasArg` return `true`.

This change is needed to address the current lack of command-line ‚Äúswitch‚Äù support in the `CommandLineConfigurationExtensions.AddCommandLine` \[üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.commandlineconfigurationextensions.addcommandline?view=net-9.0-pp) \] extension method.

There is a [[GitHub]] issue #[36024](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36024) that has been open since 2019, requesting that command-line ‚Äúswitch‚Äù support be added.

>[!important]
>[[GitHub]] issue #[177](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/issues/177) has been lodged to effect these changes.

## [[Songhay Publications - KinteSpace|kintespace.com]]: ‚ÄúSweat and stone: The children powering Nigeria's lithium boom‚Äù

But now, in an unexpected and puzzling move, the company is issuing instructions for installing Windows 11 on incompatible PCs.

## modern [[Lit]] does _not_ use shadow <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> `style` elements by default

What is clearly documented by the [[Lit]] folks is the suggestion that using shadow <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> `style` element impacts performance:

>We recommend using the [static `styles` class field](https://lit.dev/docs/components/styles/#add-styles) for optimal performance. However, sometimes you may want to define styles in the Lit template. There are two ways to add scoped styles in the template:
>
> - Add styles using a [`<style>` element](https://lit.dev/docs/components/styles/#style-element).
> - Add styles using an [external style sheet](https://lit.dev/docs/components/styles/#external-stylesheet) (not recommended).
>
>Each of these techniques has its own set of advantages and drawbacks.
>
>‚Äî‚Äù[Defining scoped styles in the template](https://lit.dev/docs/components/styles/#styles-in-the-template)‚Äù

## [[Songhay Web Components]]: all tests pass (after over four years) üëè

Yeesh:

<div style="text-align:center">

Instead of ‚Äúspies‚Äù we can take advantage of multicast eventing üêéüé†:

```typescript
inputElement.addEventListener('focus', _ => ++countForInputElementFocus);
inputElement.addEventListener('keyup', _ => ++countForInputElementKeyUp);
```

Then we can simple-ass count assertions:

```typescript
expect(countForInputElementFocus).to.be.greaterThan(0);
```

After this long-ass struggle, it has finally occurred to me that using [[Selenium WebDriver]] instead of [[Mocha]] might be more scalable here. Investigation is needed (see ‚Äú[How to Test Selenium Node.JS with Mocha](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/test-nodejs-selenium-with-mocha)‚Äù and ‚Äú[Automating Tests with Selenium #3: Integrating with Mocha](https://lo-victoria.com/automating-tests-with-selenium-3-integrating-with-mocha)‚Äù) #to-do
