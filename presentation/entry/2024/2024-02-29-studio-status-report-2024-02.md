# studio status report: 2024-02

## month 02 of 2024 was about releasing `Songhay.Player.YouTube` release 6.3.0 üì¶üöÄ

It is almost totally awesome that the `Songhay.Player.YouTube` release 6.3.0 üì¶üöÄ [project](https://github.com/users/BryanWilhite/projects/25) was completed in month 02. But, as the developer story goes, there is still more shit to do: I need to add the Presentation player that is currently used on kintespace.com to present curated stuff like my ‚Äú[blacktronic collection](http://kintespace.com/player.html#/video/youtube/presentation/blacktronic0).‚Äù Yet another project for `Songhay.Player.YouTube` will be needed as I simplt forgot to include this work in the last project üòê

I likely forgot because there was so much going on for me in month 02 as the Obsidian graph shows:

Inside of the tangle above are some selected notes:

## the [[Azure Logic App]] HTTP Connector is _not_ designed to ‚Äúfire and forget‚Äù  #day-job

Even though the HTTP Connector has [asynchronous features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/connectors-native-http?tabs=standard#asynchronous-request-response-behavior), it is expecting a 202 response at the very least _within two minutes_ (because that is the default [[Azure Logic App]] wait time \[üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config?tabs=consumption#http-request-limits) \]). In ‚Äú[Calling long-running Functions from Logic Apps](https://medium.com/@jeffhollan/calling-long-running-functions-from-logic-apps-6d7ba5044701),‚Äù Jeff Hollan (2017) details two patterns to work around this lack of default features:

>The first pattern is ‚Äúpolling‚Äù ‚Äî where the endpoint returns an immediate 202 response with a location header that points to a status endpoint. The logic app will then continue to poll the location header until a 200 response code is returned.
>
>‚Ä¶
>
>The second pattern is ‚Äúwebhook‚Äù based ‚Äî where the logic app provides a callable endpoint to notify when the work is completed. Both patterns are well documented (including a nice analogy of ordering cakes) i[n this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app#action-patterns) if you are looking for more info/samples.
>

Although, the second pattern looks ‚Äòeasy,‚Äô Hollan warns:

>The endpoint (my function) needs to return (within 2 minutes) a response so that the logic app knows the request succeeded

>[!important]
>Both of these patterns, require a 202 response.

That second pattern involves using a message queue (and orchestrated [[Azure Functions]] should work as well)‚Äîin both cases, a micro-services-friendly rewrite is required.

>[!important]
>‚Ä¶the requirement of a 202 response is the ‚Äúgateway drug‚Äù into building _bona fide_ micro-services‚Ä¶

## [[SQL Azure]]: the `DELETE` <acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym> statement that can ruin your day #day-job 

The following `DELETE` statement will eagerly delete rows instead of ‚Äòdo the right thing‚Äô and fail:

```sql
DELETE FROM [dbo].[TARGET_TABLE]
WHERE [OTHER_TABLE_ID] IN (
    SELECT [INVALID_COLUMN]
    FROM [dbo].[OTHER_TABLE]
    WHERE [REFERENCE_NAME] = 'my_ref_name'
)
```

>[!warning]
>The `SELECT [INVALID_COLUMN]` sub-query in the `IN` clause will _not_ fail and stop the `DELETE` command from running.
>

Instead, [[Microsoft]] decided to allow the `DELETE` operation to remove all the rows from `[TARGET_TABLE]` üòê

The only defense against this approach is to replace the `DELETE FROM` with `SELECT * FROM` to _test_ the effects of the proposed `DELETE`.

## [[dotnet|.NET 8.0]] has a `FakeTimeProvider`

>If we now want to test our code we can use the [Microsoft.Extensions.TimeProvider.Testing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.TimeProvider.Testing) package. This includes a `TimeProvider` implementation called `FakeTimeProvider` which gives us explicit control over the flow of time.

[[Jen Simmons]] informs me that any of the classic ways to specify color in the browser all default to the [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space; however, there are new functions for other color spaces:

- [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space: [`hsl()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl), [`hwb()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb), [`rgb()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/rgb);
- [CIELAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space) color space: [`lab()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/lab), [`lch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/lch);
- [Oklab](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/) color space: [`oklab()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklab), [`oklch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch);

## ‚ÄúJSON and JSONB support in [[SQLite]]‚Äù

>A big new feature is introduced in the SQLite 3.45.0 release ‚Äì [the SQLite JSONB](https://sqlite.org/draft/jsonb.html). The aim of this feature is to speed up the JSON manipulation, since storing JSON as BLOB will save time normally spent on parsing the standard JSON saved as string. The JSONB object consists of a header and a body. The header of each element stores its properties, like size or type. Knowing the size of the JSON element speeds up its parsing; eliminating the need of searching for the next delimiter. SQLite offers various functions for JSONB handling. Many standard JSON functions have their JSONB equivalent, like the _jsonb()_ function, which returns a JSONB object, or _jsonb_extract()_, extracting values from a JSONB blob. Many [standard JSON functions](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html) can also take JSONB blob as a parameter.

> - A harmful focus on prescriptive rules that don‚Äôt actually help software teams succeed over time
> - A lack of adaptation caused by prescriptive rules
> - Organizing code first by layers, technical stereotypes, and business entity
> - Technical coupling within a layer actually leading to problems upgrading codebases
> - Too much emphasis on using abstractions and mock object libraries to create testability

## [[Blazor Sortable]] does not <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>5 Drag and Drop?

>## Why not HTML5 Drag and Drop?
>
>Fair question and one that I certainly looked into before going to a JavaScript solution. The long and short of it is that the native HTML5 support for drag and drop simply isn‚Äôt robust enough for a decent sortable. For instance, there is no way to style much of the behaviour of the drag and drop. It looks‚Ä¶goofy‚Ä¶and there isn‚Äôt anything you can really do about it. It also has [pretty flaky support](https://caniuse.com/?search=drag) across browsers. There are some essential properties that only work in Chrome.

## [[xUnit.net]]: ‚ÄúPrefer test-doubles over mocking frameworks‚Äù

>First, a quick recap of the differences and what they give us:
>
> - **Mocking frameworks**, like Moq or NSubstitute in .NET, create proxy instances of classes or interfaces at runtime. They offer the ability to define the behavior of these proxies, such as **specifying the return values of methods** or properties, and can also **record** and verify interactions such as **method calls**.
> - **In-memory test doubles**, are types that **we write** that have **in-memory behavior** of something that would otherwise have side effects, for example, writing to a database, file system, or any other external system or service. I'll refer to these as just test doubles going forward.

>[!question]
>Can test doubles help standardize and automate test input? #to-do 

## [[Entity Framework]]: there is no longer a need to manually run and ‚Äòsniff‚Äô the network to get framework-generated <acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym> üëÉüõë

‚Äú[Entity Framework View Generated SQL](https://entityframework.net/view-generated-sql)‚Äù does not refer to <acronym title="Entity Framework">EF</acronym> _Core_ which means that there is no `System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery` as shown in the article:

```csharp
using (var context = new EntityContext())
{
    var query = context.Customers.Where(c => c.Id == 1); 
    var sql = ((System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery)query).ToTraceString();  
}
```

Instead, there is `System.Data.Entity.Core.Objects.ObjectQuery` \[üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.entity.core.objects.objectquery?view=entity-framework-6.2.0) \] for in <acronym title="Entity Framework">EF</acronym> Core.

The other, more passive way mentioned in the article involves the `DbContext.Database.Log` property‚Äîthe `Database` property is an instance of `DatabaseFacade`. Again, in <acronym title="Entity Framework">EF</acronym> Core, there is no `Log` property for `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure.DatabaseFacade` \[üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.infrastructure.databasefacade?view=efcore-8.0) \]‚Äîthe `DbContextOptionsBuilder.LogTo` method \[üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.dbcontextoptionsbuilder.logto?view=efcore-6.0) \] is used instead.. See ‚Äú[Simple Logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/logging-events-diagnostics/#simple-logging)‚Äù üìñ

## [[dotnet|.NET]]: Ian Griffiths supports my investment in walking <acronym title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</acronym> documents instead of serializing

Ian Griffiths supports my investment in two ways‚Äîfirst, is this quote:

>You might find this a little less convenient than conventional serialization, in which we define a .NET type whose structure resembles the JSON we expect to see, and then use JsonSerializer.Deserialize to convert the JSON into an instance of that type. But if you're familiar with these APIs (or you've watched and read the video and blogs linked to above) you'll know that the approach shown here places a much lower load on the garbage collector, and that it has the potential to provide much higher throughput in high-performance systems.

Second, is his ‚Äòup-sell‚Äô to `Corvus.JsonSchema` \[üîó [GitHub](https://github.com/corvus-dotnet/Corvus.JsonSchema/#corvusjsonschema) \] #to-do 

## [[Blazor]]: ‚ÄúThe FAST and the Fluent: A Blazor story‚Äù

>It is not necessary to use a framework to work with FAST components, but you can (and should). Combining them with the desired framework or library will almost always be easier. Since the beginning of 2020, there has been a broad adoption of web components. Not only Microsoft is investing heavily in the technology, but Google, Adobe, Salesforce, SAP, MIT, SpaceX, and many others are doing the same. For more information, see [https://www.fast.design/](https://www.fast.design/).

>Fluent is the design system that Microsoft uses for all its modern applications, both for the web and for Windows (OS and applications). The origin of Fluent can be found in ‚ÄúMetro‚Äù, the design system used for the Zune music player and Windows Phone devices (yeah, I still miss them too!). The system contains guidelines for the designs and interactions used within software. It has a foundation which is formed by five key components: light, depth, motion, material, and scale. Recently, the latest version, Fluent 2, was released. For more information, see [https://fluent2.microsoft.design/](https://fluent2.microsoft.design/).
