# Songhay Studio: the Sapphire Radeon R9 270X appears to be working…

The [work from 2/18](http://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/Entry/Show/songhay-studio-hardware-acquisition-strategy-one-year-later) lacked a very simple test: I should have tried a burn-in with the XFX Double R9 290X without installing any drivers just to distinguish between a pure hardware problem and driver-related issue. Nevertheless, I consider myself ‘too old’ to be suffering with fundamental system problems so ‘rolling back’ to the original plan, the [Sapphire Radeon R9 270X](http://www.amazon.com/Sapphire-Version-PCI-Express-Graphics-11217-01-20G/dp/B00B3WTWXU%3FSubscriptionId=1SW6D7X6ZXXR92KVX0G2&tag=thekintespacec00&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00B3WTWXU), seems to be the more stabilizing thing to do. The Sapphire passed my simple burn-in test and, with its latest drivers, produced no issues.

So how far did I ‘roll back’? The 290X has 4GB of DDR5 memory; the 270X has 2GB GDDR5—and I am sure that the 270X has no “…award-winning GCN Architecture for unrivalled performance and efficiency.” According a few YouTube videos, the 270X can handle anything 1080P can throw at it—but the cool kids these days are gaming for 4K and beyond.

## The Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO is too tall for my HTPC case…

[<img alt="Amazon.com product" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4180q2yqPeL.jpg" style="float:right;margin:16px;">](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0080ATR2Y/thekintespacec00A/ "Buy this product at Amazon.com!")

Spelunking with YouTube led me to the incredibly popular [Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO—CPU Cooler with 120mm PWM Fan (RR-212E-20PK-R2)](http://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Hyper-212-RR-212E-20PK-R2/dp/B005O65JXI%3FSubscriptionId=1SW6D7X6ZXXR92KVX0G2&tag=thekintespacec00&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B005O65JXI)—an Amazon #1 best seller (even [Jerry Neutron likes it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss7yvaJIQrE&feature=youtube_gdata_player); the [HiTechLegion guys installs it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EcKXj54uQI&feature=youtube_gdata_player); the [Salesberg guy puts it through its paces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMiCgH063kg&feature=youtube_gdata_player)).

Not learning anything with my previous days’ experience with graphics cards, I just ordered it (instead of ordering the original cooler, [Scythe SCBSK-2100 BIG Shuriken 2 Rev. B CPU Cooler for LGA 2011/1366/1156/1155/1150/775 and Socket FM1/AM3+/AM3/AM2+/AM2 (SCBSK-2100)](http://www.amazon.com/Scythe-SCBSK-2100-Shuriken-Cooler-Socket/dp/B0069CQ7BE%3FSubscriptionId=1SW6D7X6ZXXR92KVX0G2&tag=thekintespacec00&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0069CQ7BE), in my plan from last year). It turns out that the vertical design of the Cooler Master is designed for the thicknesses of tower cases—not [my low-slung Silverstone HTPC](http://www.amazon.com/Silverstone-GD08B-Aluminum-Extended-Computer/dp/B007X8TQYI%3FSubscriptionId=1SW6D7X6ZXXR92KVX0G2&tag=thekintespacec00&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B007X8TQYI) case ([blogged in 2012](http://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/Entry/Show/another-slather-of-hardware-to-supposedly-make-my-life-better)). So, again, I went back to the original plan. The Scythe BIG Shuriken has shipped.

Now, in the defense of Cooler Master, I am sure they would recommend the [Cooler Master GeminII M4—CPU Cooler with 4 Direct Contact Heat Pipes (RR-GMM4-16PK-R2)](http://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-GeminII-M4-RR-GMM4-16PK-R2/dp/B0080ATR2Y%3Fpsc=1&SubscriptionId=1SW6D7X6ZXXR92KVX0G2&tag=thekintespacec00&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0080ATR2Y). The [AdoptedMike guy shows us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gXh3DioIb4&feature=youtube_gdata_player) what it looks like—and complains about its size with respect to ITX motherboards. The Cooler Master (5.4 x 4.8 x 2.3 inches) has larger dimensions than the Scythe BIG Shuriken (4.9 x 5.3 x 2.3 inches).
