# studio status report: 2022-09

## month 09 of 2022 was about releasing `Songhay.Modules.Bolero` and `Songhay.Player.YouTube`

My switch to Obsidian last month has led to my use of [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) this month which allows me to draw out the entire Songhay System (in three ragged columns):

![Excalidraw drawing of the Songhay System](../../image/day-path-2022-09-28-13-29-56.png)

- the first column represents cores, mirrors and shells
- the second column represents APIs, cloud jobs and shell automation
- the final column represents publication to the outside world

We see, at the top of the first column, the newest packages of the Studio:

- `Songhay.Modules.Bolero` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Modules.Bolero)]
- `Songhay.Player.YouTube` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Player.YouTube)]

The release of these packages represent the end of ‘Presentation work’ being completely blocked by back-end work. The super-optimistic assumption here is that even a small child will be able to _see_ what I am working on in this Studio going forward. I will no longer have to explain loquaciously what on Earth am I doing! (Of course, one may refuse to look but I cannot be concerned with that and be ultimately mentally healthy.)

## what month 09 looks like

Here is the Obsidian view of the month:

Here are some selected notes from the graph above:

### a new, more accurate drawing of the Songhay System Studio

[The Excalidraw drawing above] is a study of three ragged columns…

- the first column represents cores, mirrors and shells
- the second column represents APIs, cloud jobs and shell automation
- the final column represents publication to the outside world

This drawing clearly shows that:

- the kinté space is _not_ using the Songhay B-Roll Player API ⚠
- one Azure Web Job is in use 👴🎩
- eleventy is in use in two repos 👏
- Jupyter is in use in one repo 👏

There are five places where you see the construction worker stick man that looks like this:

### F♯: while writing a <acronym title="Domain-Specific Language">DSL</acronym> for Bulma I see an alternative to `option`…

Instead of passing a type modified by `option` to a function, I made something like this:

```fsharp
type CssClassesOrEmpty =  
    | NoCssClasses  
    | Has of CssClasses
```

Instead of seeing `None` and `Some`, we see something like this:

![an alternative to `option`](../../image/day-path-2022-09-28-18-34-19.png)

Inside `bulmaTile`, we can see the `match` expression handling this `*OrEmpty` type:

![the `match` expression handling](../../image/day-path-2022-09-28-18-36-21.png)

The only snag immediately jumping out at me is the `Has` union type which could namespace-collide with other `Has` types in other discriminated unions.

### F♯ Bolero: `Songhay.Modules.Bolero` has exploded in size in one month!

This is hard work in the middle of the worst heat wave of my adult life and I am little concerned… However, `Songhay.Modules.Bolero` feels like a masterful (yet obscure) summary of my knowledge of HTML-based UI.

Apart from the `*Utility` modules, `Songhay.Modules.Bolero` uses types and modules to express my understanding of HTML and CSS, filtered by what is actually needed from HTML and CSS based on my experience and bias toward minimalism:

### Thu Vu introduces me to Panel

This looks like the way forward toward a new kinté hits page!
