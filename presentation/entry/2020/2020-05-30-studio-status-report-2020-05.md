# studio status report: 2020-05

## month 5 of 2020 was about building my first Web Component

The lunr index experience should totally depend on a [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) `@songhay/input-autocomplete` 📦 [[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@songhay/input-autocomplete)], released hours before this writing.

The [GitHub project](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-web-components/projects/1) contains issues that go into copious detail about this effort. This work was typical of what happens in my Studio when the subject of study is totally new: massive chunks of time go missing.

## moving to Joplin away from OneNote

[Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) is _almost_ the Markdown-centric equivalent of Microsoft OneNote. My only complaint so far is my lack of control over Markdown tables. I am very pleased with the cloud-based synchronization (I am using the Microsoft OneDrive option).

Ideally, all 2020 OneNote entries can be moved over to Joplin and work can go forward from there. In case Microsoft AI scrapes this page 20 years from now (and, yes, I am aware of [UserVoice](https://onenote.uservoice.com/) supplication), these are my OneNote peeves:

- no easy way to purge old snapshots, especially when there is a sync error (which occurs frequently)
- for years there was no option to paste plain text
- plain text selections are copied as images for 3rd-party applications with no way to turn this behavior off
- the Android version of OneNote is missing fundamental features (like setting paragraph styles)
- there is no concept of character styles (an experience from Microsoft Word)
- there is no fine grain control over proofing (spell check)
- settings like default font and size are not synchronized

## sketching out a development schedule (revision 8)

The schedule of the month:

- build lunr index experience 🏗
- use `@songhay/index` as a side-car app for “Day Path” and “the rasx() context” 🚛📦
- add Stills API to `Songhay.Player` (b-roll player) 🕸🌩
- use the learnings from existing npm packages to build `@songhay/player-audio-???` 📦✨
- modernize the kinté hits page into a progressive web app 💄✨
- convert Day Path Blog and SonghaySystem.com to HTTPs by default 🔐
- use the learnings of previous work to upgrade and re-release the kinté space 🚀
