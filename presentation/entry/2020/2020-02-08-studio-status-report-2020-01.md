# studio status report: 2020-01

## the first month of 2020 is about achieving desired expressive power with `eleventy`

GitHub issue, “[add flat `entries/` (index) and groupings by year](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Blog/issues/24),” records my progress with generating Blog sites with `eleventy`:

> “[Tips for Using Snippets in Your Shopify Theme](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/88186566-tips-for-using-snippets-in-your-shopify-theme)” introduces me to liquid snippets which finally give me the expressive power i have been looking for 💪… snippets eliminate the need to use absolute paths for templates that can be rendered at different directory levels 👏… i see that it is possible to group the flat index into `yyyy-MM` groups and add deep-linking support for each group [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Blog/issues/24#issuecomment-574925619)]

## the first month of 2020 is also about automating social-media posting

Social media posts tagged `#rxa 👁⚙🌩` [[hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rxa)] are generated by the new studio Azure Logic App. GitHub issue, “[automate Tweets from curated data](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Social/issues/7),” tracks this long-awaited achievement. Not another thought about HootSuite!

## sketching out a development schedule (revision 6)

Today the studio development schedule looks like this:

* ~~build out `Songhay.Player.Activities` and plug into Azure Functions~~ ✔
* ~~build out `Songhay.Social.Activities` (automated social-media posting) and plug into Azure Functions~~ 🤖🌩
* add Stills API to `Songhay.Player` (b-roll player) 🕸🌩
* use `@songhay/index` as a side-car app for “Day Path” and “the rasx() context” 🚛📦
* use the learnings from existing npm packages to build `@songhay/player-audio-???` 📦✨
* modernize the kinté hits page into a progressive web app 💄✨
* convert Day Path Blog and SonghaySystem.com to HTTPs by default 🔐
* use the learnings of previous work to upgrade and re-release the kinté space 🚀
