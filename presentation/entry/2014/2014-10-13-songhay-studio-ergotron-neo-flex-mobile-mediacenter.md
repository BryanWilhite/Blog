# Songhay Studio: Ergotron Neo-Flex Mobile MediaCenter

[A YouTube video from Geek Beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOPTPLElENk) says it all to me: Ergotron products continue to rock! The [Neo-Flex Mobile MediaCenter](http://www.ergotron.com/ProductsDetails/tabid/65/PRDID/425/language/en-US/Default.aspx) is a welcome addition to [my sense of studio space](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wilhite/7557316982/). This stand, along with [an old-fashioned drafting desk](http://www.worldmarket.com/product/drafting-desk.do?camp=CSE:Amazon:450580&camp=Aff:10078:84047:IR&utm_campaign=84047:IR&utm_source=10078&utm_medium=affiliate), would complete the cast of expensive characters in my “home office.” This “media center” would represent my quest into the world of affordable big-ass monitors. I used to look down on looking at a big ass monitor but now at my age—with my current quality of eyesight—I realize I was wrong for being so haughty.

The [Neo-Flex Mobile MediaCenter](http://www.ergotron.com/ProductsDetails/tabid/65/PRDID/425/language/en-US/Default.aspx) is sold on Amazon.com as the video states but the lowest prices I’ve seen so far are [on Provantage.com](http://www.provantage.com/ergotron-24-191-085~7ERGT0M2.htm?source=googleps).
