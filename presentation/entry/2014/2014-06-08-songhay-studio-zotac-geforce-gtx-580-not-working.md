According to [this video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7RdEs0rv2A&index=2&list=HL1402250600), I see that I am not plugging it in properly—and I possibly have misplaced the correct MOLEX connectors. It was also said that at least a 600 watt power supply is needed—and the [Enermax MODU87+ 700W](http://www.enermax.com/home.php?fn=eng/product_a1_1_1&lv0=1&lv1=54&no=69) should be enough to cover it. My PC hardware chops have really gotten soft and impotent over the years…

According to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_bc8_LrdM), the GTX 580 draws 224 watts—in 2010, it was considered top of its class “…the single, fastest GPU card on the market.” As of this writing, the GeForce brand is still recognized by [the PC Perspective Leaderboard](http://www.pcper.com/leaderboard).
