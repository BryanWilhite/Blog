The fact that Windows 10 will add a “real” Ubuntu-based bash shell very soon does suggest that I’ll not need Ubuntu VM’s for software development. There are three non-development areas where I think VMs will be in play for quite some time:

### The Ubuntu VM as a “mirror”

For folksy/legendary and probably out-of-date technical reasons, I trust Linux disks to handle tens of thousands of tiny files per folder. It follows that I trust Linux to “mirror” all of the content of kintespace.com, a Songhay System web site that dates back to 1998. I am also encouraged to used Linux because of its killer app, rsync.

### The Ubuntu VM as a backup “device”

With an understanding that there are services like Carbonite, I still feel the folksy need to “manually” backup stuff (while still in the cloud). The way toward that is via the Linux VM.

### The Ubuntu VM as an email-client host/archive

Over a decade ago the macro-virus outbreak made Outlook and other desktop email clients on Windows deeply insecure. In response, I ran to the Linux desktop (using Thunderbird) and stayed there ever since.

### The Ubuntu VM as an open-source desktop publishing ‘experiment’

In “[Songhay Studio: second printing of ‘the adolescence of the cool,’ my chapbook, will be based on open source software](http://kintespace.com/rasxlog/?p=3508),” I’m celebrating the use of tools like Scribus and GIMP to design publications. This does not mean that I would not be tempted to rent Adobe After Effects from Adobe but I must take precautions and support “open” alternatives.
