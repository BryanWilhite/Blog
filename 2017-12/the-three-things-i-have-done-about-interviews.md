My developer experience is spanning over two decades. “Somehow,” I have managed to feed myself and (most) of my children by being a software developer. I put _somehow_ in quotes because that is likely quoting one of the words people have said who have “passed” on me, over the last few years, effectively stating “objectively” that I have _failed_ the job interview.

I deliberately do not put the word _failed_ in quotes because I agree with them: I have failed. Where we are likely to disagree are in the details of the failure. The devil is in the details. But before I rant into that, let me go over the three constructive and progressive things I have done in response this failure (in order of appearance):

* I started using [LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) to [study technical subjects](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/LinqPad) under academic-laboratory conditions.
* I started publishing [my life’s work](https://github.com/BryanWilhite) as a programmer on GitHub.
* I bought books to study the internals of C#, multi-threaded programming and algorithms (and data structures).

Notice that I am not studying anything about the _acting_ performance of the interview. No concern for interviewing “technique,” hacks or tricks. This is because I assume (based on experience) that I learned how to _behave_ in an interview situation just a few years after leaving college. Any behavior from me regarded as “incorrect” by third parties are not my (primary) concern. It is an indicator of incompatibility based on “cultural fit” issues that experience has shown me are often anti-developer (or anti-_professional_-developer). All we have to do is search for “[largest data breach in history](https://www.bing.com/search?q=largest+data+breach+in+history&qs=n&form=QBLH&sp=-1&pq=largest+data+breach+in+history&sc=2-30&sk=&cvid=20B8AC26C6B64D5F96EB0CC87BF10EB0)” and find the companies listed as a “victim” of a breach and then investigate their “culture.”

## An Idealistic Disagreement over the Meaning of _Professional_

One primary way I fail at job interviews is over the disagreement over the meaning of _professional_. I regard my definition as pure and ultra-conservative:

>A professional is one who can _profess_ in public their patterns and practices that produce constructive outcomes that are valuable to a business with the intent to make these outcomes reproducible by other professionals.

In the “real” world, on the street level, a “professional” is someone who knows how to shut their mouth at the “right” times. An interview from a culture that I regard as toxic may speak to me in ways that suggest I am “somehow” unaware of this street-level definition. They may use phrases like “in a perfect world” or even “what do you want to be when you grow up?” to counter my need to conserve meaning.

Being rejected by a company over this disagreement is actually holistically healthier for me over the long term but just as financially deadly. I have no intent to get around this issue. Welcome to my world of low net worth.

## Using the Knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms As a Weapon During the Interview

What I _do_ intend to do is learn more about algorithms and data structures. On the surface (amd most of the corporate stuff is superficial), it appears that I am responding to my failures by learning more about a technical subject so that I can “succeed” at future interviews. This is not true.

I am studying algorithms because I am at a level of experience (and relative financial “comfort”) where I can take the time to learn about these rather esoteric subjects. These are subjects of my interest—and I am more than certain that should I master these subjects the interviewers who previously rejected me would _still_ find a way to reject me. This is because I am convinced they used these esoteric subjects as a way to get rid of me.

Yes, there are some low-hanging-fruit reasons based on American tradition why an interviewer would _need_ to get rid of me. But when it comes to being rejected over failing to respond correctly (on command within seconds) to algorithm-related topics, I assume that most interviewers reject me because they are trying to weed out people who are not students of computer science.

This simply means that interviewers who majored in computer science in college prefer other computer scientists. A physics guy like me is simply not welcome. So, as a physics guy, I have finally found the opportunity to study some computer science stuff and that is underway. Physics people are notorious for thinking they can learn anything. Just ask [Watson and Crick](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/watson-and-crick-discover-chemical-structure-of-dna).

On the other hand, one of the last failed interviews I had was with a person asking me algorithm stuff that I did _not_ suspect of being biased against non-computer-scientists. That particular failure had more to do with my “issues” with performing on command (and poor preparation from young tech recruiters).

## The Cultural Values around Performing on Command

I conduct job interviews myself. I have only been doing it about five years. I see two general approaches to the interview: one approach values performance on command and the other does not. The performance-on-command approach often has the subtext of suspicion of fraud and the weeding out of impostors. This is a law-enforcement or criminal-justice-system approach to interviewing that often openly offends me. Imaging meeting a person that pre-judged you as a rapist that keeps starving corpses tied up in the basement and then you “prove” to them that they are wrong about such wildly erroneous prejudgment. This resolution of a misunderstanding sounds like a happy ending until one realizes the underlying “philosophy” undergirding such wild, savage misunderstanding. Actual experience informs that people who are wildly wrong about you are wrong about other things as well—and wild misunderstandings are likely to happen again.

Anyway, let’s get back to preferring performance on command. The most flattering commentary I am willing to write on the Internet (on my technical Blog) about IT cultures that value performance on command is under what I entitle, The “Hot Girl” Approach to Interviewing. The stereotypical “hot girl” does not actually _interview_ potential candidates. The ‘pure’ definition of _interview_ does not apply here. The “hot girl” essentially finds all people replaceable. People are so cheap there is no need to learn anything about them. On the contrary, people have to learn about the “hot girl.” This “hot girl” approach works pretty well for hiring beginners, trying to find their first (or second) IT job, as these people are actually (relatively) replaceable. These replaceable people are less than five years graduated out of some kind institution where they were on the low end of some kind of hierarchical command and control structure which means they are trained to perform tasks that has little or nothing to do with their personal interests (at the moment). It is understandable that inexperienced people should be literally _disrespected_: little or zero time should be spent asking them questions based on _looking_ at their experience. Here, my purist use of the word _disrespect_ is intended to call attention to how one _does not look_ at another. When I was a developer with less than 10 years experience, I was willing to endure this disrespect.

So the two previous paragraphs allow me to say that the “hot girl” approach fused with the criminal-justice-system approach easily openly offend me _during_ the interview. I will learn no “skill” that will conceal my disgust which is another way of saying I am not a homeowner here in Southern California. I have no mortgage to pay that will “encourage” me to think twice.

## The (Technical) Interview Style I Prefer

An interviewer is representing the culture of the people that I will be working with directly. To inform me that this is not the case, is to inform me about the toxic situation of the company culture. An interviewer has taken at least five minutes to view my resume and will ask me questions based on that “intimate” knowledge. My resume is full of claims that must be verified by me. That is my _honorable_ responsibility. To suggest that one is to “busy” to take time out for this intimacy is, again, informing me about the toxic situation of the company culture.

The technical interviewer is supposed to demonstrate the supremacy of their knowledge by working from my comfort zone out towards wherever they want to go. When I conduct interviews, _I_ do this. I consider an interviewer lazy to ask me generic questions designed for “everyone” and then have the nerve to suggest by tone of voice (or through the hearsay of a recruiter) that _I_ am lazy or stupid because I fail to understand their generic, cookie-cutter quizzes. Is the lazy interviewer testing my ability to listen under pressure or is she testing my technical ability as an experienced developer? (The best lazy compromise, by the way, is the take-home test.)
