# The Three Things I Have Done about Failing in Job Interviews

My developer experience is spanning over two decades. “Somehow,” I have managed to feed myself and (most) of my children by being a software developer. I put somehow in quotes because that is likely what the people have said who have “passed” on me, over the last two years, effectively stating “objectively” that I have _failed_ the job interview.

I deliberately do not put the word _failed_ in quotes because I agree with them: I have failed. Where we are likely to disagree are in the details of the failure. The devil is in the details. But before I rant into that, let me go over the three constructive and progressive things I have done in response this failure (in order of appearance):

* I started using [LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) to study technical subjects under academic-laboratory conditions.
* I started publishing [my life’s work](https://github.com/BryanWilhite) as a programmer on GitHub.
* I bought books to study the internals of C#, multi-threaded programming and algorithms (and data structures).

Notice that I am not studying anything about the _acting_ performance of the interview. No concern for interviewing “technique,” hacks or tricks. This is because I assume (based on experience) that I learned how to _behave_ in an interview situation just a few years after leaving college. Any behavior by me regarded as “incorrect” by third parties are not my (primary) concern. It is an indicator of incompatibility based on “cultural fit” issues that experience has shown me are often anti-developer (or anti-_professional_-developer). All we have to do is search for “largest data breach in history” and find the companies listed as the victims of a breach and then investigate their “culture.”
