## studio status report: 2019-06

### the `songhay-ng-workspace` is considered awesome

[`songhay-ng-workspace`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-ng-workspace) is the _best_ UI/UX work this studio has to offer. There is quite a long way to go but this repo makes a strong statement around core data access with the Observable Data Store, the Index experience and introduces the YouTube portion of our b-roll player.

### `the-funky-knowledge-base` is the first 11ty experiment

[`the-funky-knowledge-base`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/the-funky-knowledge-base) should find its final home on GitHub. It will be converted from JSON static files to markdown. It is likely that it will replace most of my use Microsoft OneNote.

### sketching out a development schedule (revision 1)

Today the studio development schedule looks like this:

* finish modernizing `@songhay/player-video-you-tube` and `@songhay/index` into a ready state [[#11](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-ng-workspace/issues/11)]
* introduce splash page(s) to the Day Path blog (an SEO emergency‚Äî_for years_) and convert to HTTPs by default
* use the learnings from existing npm packages to build `@songhay/player-audio-???`
* convert the kint√© space blog to Hexo (this has been an emergency _for years_)
* set up automated social-media posting with Azure logic apps (and a queue of some kind?)
* modernize the kint√© hits page into a progressive web app
* use the learnings of previous work to upgrade and re-release the kint√© space

The Day Path Blog bullet was moved up because many of the later bullets will not be trackable via public GitHub issues.
