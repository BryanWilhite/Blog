# Songhay System Blog Entries ✒ Repository

This repo is a replacement/experiment for my decades-long dependency on Microsoft Word as a document archive for my [Blog](http://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/). Yes, I am that old.😉

[Zach Leatherman](https://github.com/zachleat) and other cools kids have unintentionally encouraged me to replace the “office document” concept with the markdown document presentation pipeline. It follows that this repository is full of markdown entries that use 11ty.io to feed another repo, `day-path` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/day-path)] which is published to Azure as a web site.

This separation of repos might be a bit of overkill for such a small site but umm, i get that.✌ And, by the way, none of this inspiration would be possible (for me🧓) without the Microsoft “innovation” around [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
